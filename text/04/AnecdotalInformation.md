Anecdotal information is problematic for several reasons, and I have
highlighted some of these reasons in a [speech I gave at the 2004
meeting of the Midwest Society for Pediatric
Research](GoldStandard.html).

Catherine Fiorello highlights the weakness of the anecdotal argument
\"*I was spanked as a child and I turned out okay.*\" Such an
observation ignores the need for a comparison group. Such a group would
help answer the question \"*What would I have been like if I hadn\'t
been spanked as a child?*\" When large groups of both spanked and
unspanked children are compared, the unspanked children tend to fare
better. They are less aggressive and have fewer problems with
depression.

This research is prospective, which is important. With retrospective
data (how much did you spank your child in the last two years and how
often did your child misbehave in the past two years) it would be
impossible to disentangle causes and effects (did the child misbehave
more because of being spanked or did the parent spank because the child
misbehaved so often).
