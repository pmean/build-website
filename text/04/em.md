I received an email question about the EM Algorithm. This is a
computational approach that works well for missing data problems and
data models with latent (unobserved) variabels. The basic approach is to
estimate the missing or latent data (E-step), compute maximum likelihood
estimates that incorporates the missing/latent estimates (M-step), then
update the missing or latent data (E-step) and so forth. There\'s a book
by McLachlan and Krishnan, The EM Algorithm and Extensions, that I have
not seen, but which sounds pretty good. There are also a few good web
sites about this algorithm.

If I get some time, I will show a simple example on my web pages.
