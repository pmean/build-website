**[StATS]: Small relative risk (June 30, 2004)**.

> Someone asked me about small relative risk. It was only 1.12, but
> because of the large sample size, it was still statistically
> significant. This person wanted to discount the relative risk because
> anything less than 2 is unreliable.
>
> This is a point of controversy. I don\'t think that you should
> disregard a relative risk less than 2.0, but I do think you need to
> hold it to a higher level of scrutiny.
>
> Hill published nine criteria for causation in 1964, and these were
> intended as general criteria, and not to be interpreted too literally.
> One of the nine criteria was \"strength of association\" and a
> relative risk less than 2 fails to meet this criteria. But if other
> criteria (such as replication, dose response, biological plausibility)
> are met, then you can put a lot of faith in that result.
>
> If your small relative risk was unreplicated, you couldn\'t come up
> with a plausible mechanism, and so forth, then don\'t trust that
> finding. That doesn\'t mean you don\'t publish. But you publish with a
> lot of cautions and reservations. The final sentence should read,
> \"The results of this research should be replicated, so someone please
> give me a nice fat research grant.\"
