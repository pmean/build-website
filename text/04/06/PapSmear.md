**[StATS]: Pap smears for women without a cervix
(June 24, 2004)**.

> In the most recent issue of JAMA is an article by Sirovich and Welch,
> Cervical Cancer Screening Among Women Without a Cervix
> [\[Abstract\]](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/291/24/2990)
> that estimates almost 10 million women in the United States have
> received a pap smear unnecessarily because they have had a full
> hysterectomy and no longer have a cervix. For women who have had only
> a partial hysterectomy or where the hysterectomy was done for cervical
> neoplasia, regular pap smears are recommended. For the other women,
> though, this is an unnecessary test, because the pap smear is trying
> to detect cancer in an organ that the woman no longer has.
>
> It makes for an interesting thought experiment. What would the
> [sensitivity](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/sensitivity.htm),
> [specificity](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/specificity.htm),
> [positive predictive
> value](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/ppv.htm), and [negative
> predictive value](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/npv.htm) be for
> such a test? It\'s a useful way to review the fundamental definitions
> for these terms. Try to work this out in your head before reading any
> further.

> Let\'s tackle the list in reverse order. The negative predictive value
> is the probability that you do not have the disease, given that you
> tested negative. The denominator is the number of women who test
> negative and the numerator is the number of women among these who do
> not have the disease. The answer has to be one since all of the women
> who test negative do not have cervical cancer.
>
> The positive predictive value is the probability that you do have the
> disease given that you tested positive. The denominator is the number
> of women who test positive and the numerator is the number of women
> among these who actually have the disease. The answer here is zero,
> because the numerator is zero.
>
> Specificity is the probability that you test negative given that you
> don\'t have the disease. The denominator in this case is the number of
> women without the disease (which in this case is everyone). You can\'t
> actually estimate this value without more information, but specificity
> would end up being the same as the proportion of women without a
> cervix who end up testing negative.
>
> Sensitivity is the probability that you test positive given that you
> have the disease. The denominator is the number of women with the
> disease. Here the denominator is zero, which produces a fraction that
> most mathematicians will sneer at. You cannot estimate sensitivity.
>
> You can also view sensitivity as one minus the false negative rate.
> You could argue that it is impossible to have a false negative, so the
> sensitivity is one. Mathematicians would quibble with this answer,
> since both the numerator and denominator for the false negative rate
> have to be zero. Zero divided by zero makes for a very unhappy
> fraction.
>
> Realistically, no one would ever estimate or report any of these
> quantities in such an extreme case. But I think it\'s a good excuse to
> review these definitions. This example is, perhaps, a bit of an
> oversimplification. A pap smear performed on a woman without a cervix
> does have a limited ability to detect vaginal cancer, but with an
> unacceptably high false positive rate.
