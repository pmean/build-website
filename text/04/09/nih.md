**[StATS]: Nitty Gritty NIH (September 3, 2004)**

> Bill Caskey talked about some of the nitty gritty details of the NIH
> Grant process. His talk focused mostly on what happens after a grant
> gets funded.
>
> NIH started as a one-room Laboroatory of Hygine in 1887. There are 27
> separate institutes and centers. They estimate the budget to be 28
> billion in 2005 and 38 thousand research project grants. You should
> visit their web site at [www.nih.gov](http://www.nih.gov/).
>
> There are a number of things that can slow down the award process: 
>
> -   Budgets with inadequate justification,
>
> -   Delays in sending Just in Time (JIT) information,
>
> -   Missing information for key personnel,
>
> -   Other support indicates scientific, budgetary, or commitment
>     overlap (80% is a magic number. If you exceed,
>
> -   Checklist F&A that doesn\'t make sense, Most of these are
>     incorrect.
>
> -   Out of date IRB/IACUC approvals
>
> -   Lack of population data for clinical grants
>
> -   Information sent without identification, (NIH gets 30 thousand
>     grant applications on each grant deadline).
>
> -   Lack of appropriate institutional signatures.
>
> When you get the Notice of Grant Award (NGA), you should read it. It
> has the terms and conditions, citing the Code of Federal Regulation
> (government-wide requirements) and the Grants Policy Statement (the
> NIH specific requirements), information about the closeout term, and
> grant specific information about restrictions and what must be done by
> when to remove restrictions. Failure to follow any restriction means
> disallowance of costs. It also gives the name of the Grants Management
> Officer who signed the NGA, contact information for the Grants
> Specialist and the Grants Officer. You should know these names!
>
> You need prior approval from the NIH in the change in the scope of
> work, pre-award costs more than 90 days prior to effiective date of
> new or competing award, change in key personnel, change in grantee
> institution, change in grantee status, or addition of a foreign
> component, any activities disapproved or restricted.
>
> A change in scope usually means a change in specific aims,
> substitution of one animal model for another, change from approved use
> of animals or human subjects, shift in research emphasis to different
> disease area, application of a new technology (i.e., changing to a
> different type of assay), significant rebudgeting (more than 25% of
> total direct costs awarded). 
>
> Withdrawal of the PI or key personnel, absence for period of 3
> continuous months, reduction of percent effort by a quarter or more.
>
> Unobligated funds of more than 25% of the current project period
> budget indicates either lack of progress, or perhaps the PI has asked
> for an excessive budget.
>
> You can ask for a supplemental request for a single isolated
> emergency, unanticipated cost increases, bridge funding to maintain
> project momentum, near certain major advance, and
> minority/disability/reentry supplement.
>
> If you have more than one NIH grant, if a cost cannot be reasonably
> allocated to a specific project, it can be charged to any or all of
> the benefiting projects on any reasonable basis.
>
> You can\'t have 0% commitment to a project and still be listed as a
> key personnel.
>
> The PHS 398 form has been revised, and the NIH is trying to harmonize
> this with electronic submissions. You may need to get a NIH Commons
> ID.
>
> SNAP Streamlined Noncompeting Application Process
>
> Data sharing requirements. Required for all applications requesting at
> least \$500,000 (direct costs) in any single budget period, or you
> need to state why data sharing is not possible. You can request funds
> for data sharing and archiving. The plan needs to be assessed by the
> NIH program staff and any concerns have to be resolved prior to award.
>
> Failure to submit timely reports may affect future funding for you
> and/or your institution.
>
> The NIH Commons is worth looking at. This is an effort to streamline
> much of the grants process. In particular, you can now optionally
> submit competitive grants electronically.
