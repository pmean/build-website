2004)**

I rarely find time to read the Statistics journals anymore, but I did
run across an excellent article in the September 2004 issue of JASA.

> **The Price of Kaplan-Meier.** Meier P, Karrison T, Chappell R, Xie H.
> Journal of the American Statistical Association 2004: 99(467);
> 890-896.

This article refers to another article by Rupert Miller published in
1983 with the provocative title \"What Price Kaplan-Meier?\".
