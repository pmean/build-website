**[StATS]: International Classification of
Functioning, Disability, and Health (September 10, 2004)**.

Donald Lollar presented a seminar: \"The International Classification of
Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF).\" The ICF is a framework for
classifying health status that complements ICD codes. The ICF focuses on
body functions and structures, activities and participation, and
environmental factors. Dr. Lollar highlighted how the ICF might be used
to distinguish the diverse range of  functioning among children who have
autism and PDD.
