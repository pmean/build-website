Someone asked me for some help with calculating an appropriate sample
size for a study comparing two treatments, where the outcome measure is
ordinal (degree of skin toxicity: none, slight, moderate, severe). It
turns out that an excellent discussion of the various approaches appears
in a recent journal article with full free text on the web.

If your data is normally distributed, then the classic formulas for
sample size work just fine.

If your data is continuous, but non-normal, then the Mann-Whitney test
is a good choice. Define the effect size, P, as P[Y>X], where Y and X
are randomly selected values from the treatment and control groups. The
formula for the sample size is

![ordinal12.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/images/images/04/OrdinalLogistic02.png)

You want to select P so that the two distributions, normal or
non-normal, are separated by an amount that is clinically relevant.

If your data is a small number of ordered categories, then an ordinal
logistic regression model is an attractive choice. Ordinal logistic
regression relies on the proportional odds assumption. Consider an
ordinal variable with four levels: A, B, C, and D. You could compute an
odds ratio by partitioning the data

-   with A on one side and B/C/D on the other,
-   with A/B on one side and C/D on the other, or
-   with A/B/C on one side and D on the other.

The proportional odds assumptions says that no matter which of these
partitions you choose, you still end up with the same odds ratio.

If you have a set of control probabilities, it is easy to see what the
treatment probabilities will be under the proportional odds assumption.
Let's start with the probabilities listed below.

![ordinal03.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/images/images/04/OrdinalLogistic03.png)

Compute the cumulative probabilities, that is,   the probability of A,
then A/B, then A/B/C, and then A/B/C/D. The last of these has to equal
1.00.

Now compute the cumulative odds, which is just the cumulative
probability divided by its complement. For example, in column C, the
cumulative probability is 0.8. The cumulative odds would be 0.8/0.2 =
4.0. You won't be able to compute an odds for the last column.

Multiply those odds by a common ratio. Here we use a common ratio of
2.0.

![ordinal06.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/images/images/04/OrdinalLogistic06.png)

Convert the odds back into cumulative probabilities.

Finally convert the cumulative probabilities back into simple
probabilities.

Here's what the calculations would look like if the odds ratio was 0.33
rather than 2.0.

The formula for sample size with ordinal logistic regression is

![ordinal13.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/images/images/04/OrdinalLogistic12.png)

Let's look at all three calculations at the same time. First, let's
assume that categories A through D can be represented by the numbers 0
through 3. With probabilities of 25%, 25%, 30%, and 20% for the control
group and 40%, 27%, 22%, and 11% for the treatment group, you would have
means (sd) of 1.45 (1.07) and 1.04 (1.03) respectively. Using the larger
of the two standard deviations, we get an effect size of 0.38. With the
smaller standard deviation, your effect size is 0.40.

With a two sided alpha level of 0.05 and power of 80%, the estimated
sample size would somewhere between 100 and 107.

With a bit of effort, you can calculate P, the probability that a
randomly selected treatment is larger than a randomly selected control.
That probability is 39.3%. With the same alpha level and power, the
estimated sample size would be 115.

For the ordinal logistic regression, the values for pi-bar would be
32.5%, 26%, 26%, and 15.5%. Again using the same alpha and power, we get
a sample size of 106.

I have a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that performs [sample size
calculations for the ordinal logistic regression
model](../00files/PowerForProportionalOddsModel.xls). It is not
thoroughly tested, so use it at your own risk.
