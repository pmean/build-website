**[StATS]: Overlooking one\'s own flaws (created
2004-05-03)**.

Can we ever be truly objective about ourselves? Maybe not. A recent
article in Scientific AmericanÂ  by Michael Shermer, [The Enchanted
Glass](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00044900-A374-1084-983483414B7F0000&ref=sciam&chanID=sa006),
talks about the tendency to see ourselves more positively than our
peers. For example, when asked the probability that certain people will
go to heaven, the surveyors listed Bill Clinton at 52%, Mother Theresa
at 79% and so forth. But these same people rated their own probability
at 87%. Shermer also cites an experiment where research subjects were
randomly assigned to receive either high or low marks on a \"social
intelligence\" test. When asked about the quality of the test, those
receiving low marks were more critical of the fairness and utility of
the test.

A closely related concept appears in a 1998 Annual Review of Psychology
article by Robert MacCoun which is available in [web
format](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~maccoun/ar_bias.html) or [pdf
format](http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~maccoun/MacCoun_AnnualReview98.pdf).
People are more likely to find flaws in research that they strongly
disagree with and are more likely to overlook flaws in research that
they agree with. It\'s partly for this reason that I like to use
examples of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in my teaching. Most
students have their skeptical viewpoint turned up to full power when I
talk about things like homeopathy. The trick, then, is to get them to
recognize the critical reasons for mistrusting this type of research and
then getting them to apply it to areas that are more traditional.

Adam Elga has a [nice article in pdf
format](http://www.princeton.edu/~adame/papers/astrology/astrology.pdf)
about the tendency to be uncritical or unskeptical about one\'s own
personal beliefs. Two excellent books by Thomas Gilovich, Why People
Believe Weird Things and How We Know What Isn\'t So: The Fallibility of
Human Reason in Everyday Life, are also worth reading.
