So you've decided to implement a quality control program in your
laboratory. What will it take to make that program successful? There
are three steps, and you must follow these steps in order.

-   Step 1. Establish management support.
-   Step 2. Measure your process.
-   Step 3. Experiment.

Every work situation is different, of course, but these steps are a
useful guideline. Start first with management support.

**Step 1. Establish management support.**

If you are already the boss, congratulations. **A quality control
program is easiest to implement from the top down.** Make sure you
understand the commitment of time and money that is involved. Every
workplace is different, but think about allocating 10% of your time
and 10% of the time of all your employees to quality control. **Don't
pretend that you can implement a serious quality control program in
the margins of free time.** You have to re-allocate time that normally
would be used "getting the real work done."

If you are not the boss, you have to convince someone else that your
company has to make a **substantial re-investment of resources**.
That's not an easy thing to do, but you do need support from your
boss. Otherwise, you'll be asked to put the quality control project
on hold once the first new crisis appears at work. What, you have no
crises at your job? Maybe I should come and work for you.

To make your case with management, you need to convince them that

1.  variation exists in all processes,
2.  variation comes in two flavors, and
3.  there are established ways to reduce variation.

**Variation exists in all processes.** This is something that should
be obvious, but we often forget it. Here's a simple exercise to
illustrate this. Perform the exercise in the box before you read any
further.

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9901.gif)

There are several reasons why two different people could come up with
different answers to this exercise. First, there is human error, it's
easy to miss things. Second there are ambiguous situations-did you
include the sentence of instructions in your count? Third, people may
apply different standards-do you include capital letters in your
count?

If variation exists in a simple exercise like this, how much more
likely is it to occur in a complex work process?

**Exercise:** Select a work process in your area. List all of the
possible causes for variation in that work process.

**Variation comes in two flavors.** Not all types of variation are the
same, and treating them so creates problems. **Common causes** of
variation are factors that are present at all times that contribute to
variation in all of the output from a work process. **Special causes**
of variation are factors which appears sporadically and contribute to
variation for only some of the output from a process. Special causes
can usually be assigned to a particular source.

Deming had a **"red bead" exercise** that he used in all his course.
Five volunteer workers would dip their paddles into a bag of red and
white beads in order to "produce" white beads. Inspectors count the
number of defective (red) beads and then Deming praises or chastises
the workers according to their output. A second round of production
ensues and the workers who did well the first time slip back and those
who did poorly end up doing better. The cycle continues with Deming
trying to exhort the workers to do better, when it was actually the
process itself that was causing the variation.

The red bead experiment is a classic example of taking a common cause
of variation and labeling it a special cause. Managers love to do
this. Any small change in the process has to have a "variance
report" that finds a specific person of thing to blame.

**Exercise:** examine the sources of variation in the previous
exercise. Classify them as common cause or special cause variation.

**There are established ways to reduce variation.** There are good and
bad ways to reduce variation, but unfortunately there are more bad
ways than good ways. Here are some examples of bad ways to reduce
variation:

-   Rewards and punishments.
-   Posters and slogans.
-   Blame the workers.

The best way to reduce variation is to identify special causes of
variation and then remove them. Once the special causes are gone, you
have a stable process that is amenable to experimentation. Run
experiments to remove common causes of variation.

**Identify and remove special causes.** This step has to come first.
Monitor your process using a control chart when you find a point out
of control, investigate and find the assignable cause to that out of
control point. Fix that problem and continue to monitor the work
process.

**Identify and remove common causes.** This step has to come second.
Once the process is in control, you then have to identify common
factors that influence all of the output. Manipulate these common
factors in experiments to reduce variation.

It's very important to remove all special causes first. You can't
run an experiment effectively if there are special causes which appear
at unexpected times. They'll contaminate the experiment and make the
results much harder to interpret.

**Step 2. Measure your process.**

It was Socrates who first said   that an unexamined life is not worth
living. As a professional statistician, I believe that an unanalyzed
data set is not worth collecting. There are several ways to measure a
work process.

1.  Flow diagrams
2.  Pareto charts
3.  Cause and effect diagrams
4.  Control charts

There are plenty of resources for how to use each of these tools, but
the key question should be, what should I measure? My advice is to
start small and start well downstream.

**Start small.** There is a large start-up cost for a quality control
program and you don't want to try to do everything at once. Look for
the low hanging fruit--those areas where it is easy to measure things
and where there is a strong prospect for time/money savings.

**Start well downstream.** By "downstream," I mean near the end of
the entire work process. Measure something that represents the
end-product--what the customer sees. As you start to understand the
end-product better then you will need to look at some of the
intermediate processes that contribute to the end-product. This is
moving upstream.

**Step 3. Experiment.**

Once you have established a stable process, you want to improve that
process, either by lowering the mean or shrinking the width of the
control limits. Experimentation is the key to either approach.

When you run an experiment, you should follow the PDSA cycle
(Plan-Do-Study-Act).

**Plan.** What sort of change to the work process are you considering?
What is the current work process? How well/poorly does the current
work process do?

**Do.** Implement the planned change. Measure the impact of the
change.

**Study.** Analyze the measurements. Did the change make things better
or worse?

**Act.** If the change is better, implement that change in all future
work. Make sure that the change persists.

The whole experiment will probably raise new questions to study, which
starts the whole cycle over again.

**Exercise:** All four steps in the PDSA cycle are important. What
happens if skip the Study step? What happens if you skip the Act
step?

**Summary**

Setting up a quality program is not easy. First **get management
support**. Without that support all your efforts will be refocussed at
the first work crisis. Second, **measure your process**. Start small
and start well downstream. Third, **experiment**. Follow the plan, do,
study, act cycle.

**Appendix: Examples of control chart calculations**

Here is some data on a work process that involves drilling. I'm not
quite sure where I originally found this data.


![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9902.gif)

Notice that the drill bit is replaced after nine days. The right had
side shows some simple calculations for a control chart. You compute
an average and a range for each subgroup. The averages are then
averaged to get an overall mean (Xbarbar) and an average range (Rbar).

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9903.gif)

The formulas for the control limits are

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9904.gif)

where the constant, A~2~, can be found in any quality control text
book. The chart for the range looks like

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9905.gif)

and the formulas for the control limits are

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9906.gif)

Again, the constants, D~3~ and D~4~, are in any quality control text
book.

**Exercise:** What change to the work process does this control
chart suggest?

**Rules for identifying special causes.**

There are many rules that have been proposed for deciding when a
special cause has occurred. A good summary of these rules appears on
pages 135-140 of Wheeler (1995).

The simplest rule, and the one that appears to be universally adopted
is when **a single point lies outside the control limits**. This
indicates a sudden large shift in the process.

A second rule is to declare a special cause variation when **eight
consecutive points lie on the same side of the center line**. This
rule is attractive because it is simple to apply and it is sensitive
to gradual shifts or trends that the first rule might miss.

**Other rules involve dividing the control chart into zones** (e.g.,
more than one standard deviation from the center line, more than two
standard deviations from the center line) and noting whether two out
of three or three out of four points fall into certain zones. There
are also rules about a **sequence of consecutively increasing or
consecutively decreasing points** or a **sequence that hops too
frequently** from one side to the other of the center line or a
**sequence that hugs too closely to the center line**.

On page 139, Wheeler warns that **too many rules increase the chances
for a false alarm**. The first two rules (one point outside control
limits; eight consecutive points on the same side of the center line)
work very well in practice and **there is little justification for
adopting more complex rules**. This is especially true if you are just
starting out with a quality control program.

**Control charts for individual values**

Sometimes, there is no easy way to grab a batch of two or more
measurements. The measurements that you get are **distinct and cannot
be put into batches** without some degree of "ad hoc"ery. For these
situation, an XmR chart works well. Here is an example.

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9907.gif)
![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9908.gif)

This example appears in section 6.4 of Wheeler and Poling (1998). The
data represents accounts receivable as a percentage of sales. This is
an important accounting ratio that describes how quickly bills are
collected. A large percentage is bad and indicates that accounts
receivable tends to be slow or overdue.

Rather than compute a range within a batch, a moving range is
computed. **The moving range is the range between each successive pair
of observations.** The moving range provides an alternative method for
measuring short term variation. The average of the moving ranges is
used to compute control limits using formulas similar to those shown
above.

Here is what the control limits look like

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9909.gif)

There is also a moving range chart for this data, which I do not
display.

**Control charts for counts**

There are several control chart choices when your data represents
counts. The simplest choice is the c-chart. Here's an example that
appears on page 272 of

-   **SPC for the Rest of Us: A Personal Path to Statistical
    Control.** Hy Pitt (1994) Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley
    Publishing Company, Inc. [BookFinder4U
    link]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0201563665.html)
    **(Statistics, Control Charts)**

The data appears below:

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9910.gif)

The average number of defects is

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9911.gif)

The formula for the control limits is

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9912.gif)

In this example, the lower control limit is negative, which is
impossible. When this happens, you should set the lower control limit
to zero. The control chart looks like the following:

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/quality-9913.gif)

Note that **any number of defects from 0 to 5 would be considered
common cause variation**. There are two special causes to investigate:
hoods #6 and #13. Although the author of this example does not give
a specific explanation for these two points, he does offer the
following possibilities: differences in the diligence or training
among inspectors; a counting/recording error; or some change in the
manufacturing process itself.

The C chart has potential application to the surveillance of employee
injuries and illnesses. An example of such a chart even appears in the
book Wheeler and Poling (page 186). Nevertheless, there are **several
difficulties with using a C chart for injuries and illnesses**.

First, the assumptions of a Poisson distribution are questionable. If
injuries and illnesses events in one month are correlated with one
another, then the assumptions are a Poisson distribution are violated.
A simple example of correlation would be if one of the illness
categories represented an infectious disease like influenza. The
assumptions of the Poisson distribution are also violated if there is
heterogeneity in the distribution of injury and illness events. This
might occur if certain times of the months, certain employees, or
certain areas of the workplace, are more prone (or less prone) to have
specific injuries and illnesses.

**Which chart should I use?**

Eventually, you should learn how to run a wide range of control
charts. But to start with, I would encourage you to **learn the XmR
chart first**. This is the simplest and most versatile chart and can
handle most commonly encountered situations. It is not always as
efficient as an Xbar/Rbar chart, but **simplicity rather than
efficiency is more important** when you are just starting.
