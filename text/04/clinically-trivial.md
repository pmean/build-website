I don't like to cite articles in the New York Times, because they are
free on the web only for a couple of weeks. But an article by Denise
Grady, [Nominal Benefits Seen in Drugs for
Alzheimers](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/07/health/07ALZH.html?ex=1082545788&ei=1&en=6aa8ecca5c561087),
published on April 7 is worth mentioning. Try to review this article
before it disappears on April 21.

Grady writes that drugs to treat Alzheimer patients are expensive, and
it is unclear how much they really help.

*Clearly, the drugs can alter brain chemistry, and some studies show
statistically significant improvements on tests that measure thinking
and memory. But while a few extra points on a mental exam, or other
changes obvious to a specialist, may be enough to get a drug approved
by the Food and Drug Administration, they may not be enough to help a
person with Alzheimer's dementia function in the real world. "You
can name 11 fruits in a minute instead of 10," said Dr. Thomas
Finucane, a professor at Johns Hopkins and a geriatrician. "Is that
worth 120 bucks a month?"*

This is a classic example of both clinical importance and surrogate end
points. Typically, patients in randomized trials are assessed using
tests of memory. But is the ability to name fruits really of interest to
patients? Also, is the ability to name 11 fruits rather than 10
worthwhile from a patient's perspective.

*Dr. Jason Karlawish, a geriatrician at the University of
Pennsylvania's Institute on Aging, said, "There is substantial
controversy over the claim that current F.D.A.-approved treatments
improve function or slow a patient's decline." He blamed several
factors for the controversy, including "the lack of widely understood
and accepted measures to show improvement or slowing of decline, small
effects on the few measures some experts agree are appropriate, and
controversial and even outrageous approaches to analyzing the data to
make the claim the drug slows a patient's decline." Dr. Karlawish,
Dr. Finucane and other researchers said they were particularly irked
by a study published last July in The Journal of the American
Geriatrics Society, claiming that Aricept could delay a patient's
need for nursing-home care by nearly two years - something that would
clearly matter to patients and families.*

The latter claim, which has been criticized, is indeed the type of
outcome that patients are interested in. There is an acronym, POEM,
which stands for Patient Oriented Events that Matter. Patients are only
interested in morbidity, mortality, or quality of life.

Along the same lines, I co-authored an editorial with Jay Portnoy, **Is
3-mm Less Drowsiness Important?**, which appeared in the October 2003
issue of the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. We commented on a
study that showed a statistically significant difference in drowsiness
scores. Drowsiness was measured using a visual analog scale. This is a
line, usually 10 centimeters in length. You are asked to draw a mark on
the line representing how drowsy you feel, with the left end of the line
representing no drowsiness and the right end of the line representing
the most drowsiness possible. In this study, the difference between the
two drugs was 3 millimeters. Here's an image that shows the size of 3
millimeters on a 10 centimeter scale. On your screen, of course, or on
your printer, these lines may not be equal to exactly 10 centimeters,
but the distances should be proportional.

Is a difference of 3 mm large enough to justify a claim of "less
drowsy"? The authors of the study do not discuss this, and quite
honestly, most researchers do not either (Chan 2001; Thomson 2000). It
seems that once you compute a p-value, you stop thinking. This is a bad
habit. While statistical significance is an important finding, it is
also important to discuss practical relevance. Does an extra 3 mm make
it safe to drive a car or to operate heavy machinery?

The visual analog scale is also used for pain assessments, and here
there is some guidance for what is considered clinically important. A
score of 30 mm or less is considered little or no pain (Bodian 2001),
and a change of 10 mm is considered clinically relevant (Powell 2001).

In other areas, it is well known that grapefruit consumption can alter
the metabolic pathways of a liver enzyme, CYP3A. Is this altering
sufficiently large, though, to warrant a warning? An editorial
(Abernathy 1997) discusses this and concludes that only an unusually
high consumption of grapefruits would warrant any serious concern.

A review of randomized trials of head injury (Dickinson 2000) suggests
that a 5% absolute improvement would be considered clinically relevant,
though a letter to the editor (Murray 2000) suggests the perhaps even a
10% absolute improvement would not be clinically important. Given the
severity of outcomes in head injuries, I would tend to side with
Dickinson, but it is very difficult to detect differences this small.

There are many aspects to this problem which I'll try to discuss when I
have time:

-   clinical importance in negative studies
-   particularizing findings to an individual patient
-   measuring clinical importance using absolute measures (e.g., NNT)
