> Mark Barnes gave a seminar on August 2, 2004 on Secondary Uses of
> Biologic Materials and Medical Data by Researchers and Commercial
> Research Sponsors. Here are my notes taken at that seminar.
>
> There are a broad range of regulations and agreements that apply to
> secondary uses:
>
> -   Any contract you might sign with a commercial sponsor of the
>     research.
>
> -   The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
>     places criminal sanctions on researchers who disclose protected
>     health information to the wrong people.
>
> -   The Common Rule (45 CFR Part 46) applies to any research conducted
>     by an institution receiving funding from the NIH if that
>     institution has signed a FWA.
>
> -   FDA regulations
>
> -   Voluntary accreditation standards for IRBs
>
> -   State laws and litigation
>
> -   International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ICMJE standards
>
> -   Industry standards (PhRMA)
>
> Be careful because state laws often have something to say about HIV
> testing, mental health records, and genetic testing. These state laws
> will often apply above and beyond any federal laws.
>
> But you are also constrained by your own ethical concerns.
>
> Some of the legal constraints in health care do not apply to a
> commercial sponsor. If they are free to disclose information or use it
> in ways that you would not consider appropriate, you place yourself
> and your instituation in a very difficult position. Before you give
> your data to a commercial sponsor, you should impose contractual
> constraints on commercial sponsors to limit their use of data/tissue?
>
> Can there be informed consent to future uses? The are two extremes on
> this issue:
>
> -   Subjects cannot agree to a future research project about which
>     they have not been, and cannot be, informed.
>
> -   Subjects should be permitted to \"donate\" their own
>     data/materials for future uses.
>
> You need to disclose the operation of the data/tissue repository, the
> specific types of research to be conducted, the conditions under which
> the data/specimens will be released to investigators, and procedures
> put in place to protect the privacy of the data/specimens.
>
> The IRB will ask what constitutes a new or different study?
>
> There are both patient privacy concerns and property rights concerns.
>
> Do subjects have the right to revoke their consent to future uses?
> Note that if the data has been de-identified, then it is effectively
> impossible to remove the data.
>
> NCI informed consent allows patients to check yes or no to three
> questions (see web link).
>
> Commercialization of data/materials
>
> Sometimes universities and companies can make money by patenting and
> licensing technologies derived from tissues. Even data alone might
> have commercial value. Asking a research subject to waive their
> commercial rights is exculpatory language, which is forbidden in the
> federal regulations. There have been several examples of litigation
> over commercialization of research products.
>
> **Greenberg v. Miami Children\'s Hospital**. Miami Children\'s applied
> for a patent on some work derived from research performed by
> volunteers. Some of these volunteers were upset because they freely
> sacrificed their time and endured many inconveniences, risks, and
> discomforts. They did this because they wanted to help other patients
> with disease and not to enrich Miami Children\'s Hospital. The court
> held that failure to gain consent of patients on Canavan\'s disease on
> the commercialization of research products represented unjust
> enrichment.
>
> **Washington University v. Catalona**. Bill Catalona wanted to take
> specimens and information from patients he recruited while working at
> Washington University when he left for Northwestern University. He
> sent a letter to all his patients (without clearing it first with
> Washington University) asking them to sign a consent statement
> allowing him to keep their tissues and to continue treating them.
>
> **Tilousi v. Arizona State University**. Members of the Havasupai
> Indian tribe donated blood samples that were taken during a diabetes
> study and later used them without permission and without adequate IRB
> oversight in unrelated studies of schizophrenia, inbreeding, and
> theories regarding the migration of humans to North America, resulting
> in 23 scholarly papers and 15 publications.
>
> HIPAA requires compound authorization.
>
> Most Clinical Trial Agreements protect the proprietary information
> from the company but do not impose a requirement in return on the
> company to protect confidential information from the patients. If your
> informed consent promises privacy and confidentiality, and you do not
> seek restrictions in the CTA, then you are misrepresenting
>
> De-identification removes the right of revocation and prevents
> tracing.
>
> Data/materials collected during standard of care potentially falls
> under a different standard.
>
> It\'s more important than ever to have clear and understandable
> informed consent forms because if you are sued, it will be scrutinized
> by a judge and/or jury with a typical lay person\'s understanding of
> the issues.

> If you store records of your own practice in a separate location, then
> be careful. Even if you do nothing \"researchy\" with the data right
> away, you should submit a general databanking protocol to the IRB with
> continuing review every year. The protocol would describe how you will
> store the records, what information will be stored, and what security
> measures you will implement to insure privacy. You should specify in
> braod terms how you think the data will be used, though you might not
> know enough to specify the proposed research in any great detail.
> Perhaps more important would be to state the things that you would NOT
> do.

> Hold, store, catalog, replenishing, You will need prospective consent.

> Further questions (August 3, 2004)
>
> How does an IRB handle adverse event reports (AE)? A committee of FDA
> and OHRP is working on consistency of reporting of AEs. Committee has
> to do \"triage\" on AE reports. The full IRB would only review serious
> AEs that are related to the drug/device. Especially critical is a
> review of any AEs that are not mentioned in the informed consent form.
>
> Registry studies can raise some serious ethical concerns. Registry
> studies represent surveillance after approval of a device/drug. One
> important justification is to monitor for side effects, something that
> is always difficult to do well during the efficacy testing of the
> drug. Sometimes though, these databases are used for marketing rather
> than research. Be cautious of studies of an uncertain or unlimited
> duration. Make sure that the the registry does indeed serve a
> reasonable scientific purpose? You need a promise to never use the
> data for marketing purposes and that company will never contact your
> patients directly.
