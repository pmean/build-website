> Dexamethasone is a treatment for chronic lung disease in very low
> birthweight infants. Three different timings of medication were
> studied, and the one that showed the greatest effect was when
> dexamethasone was started within 7 to 14 days of birth. The NNT is 8
> for mortality, meaning that you would have to treat 8 infants on
> average with dexamethasone to prevent one death. The NNT for
> prevention of chronic lung disease (CLD) at 28 days was 6, meaning
> that you would have to treat 6 infants on average to prevent one case
> of CLD. There was a significant increase in the risk of hypertension
> in this group, with an NNH of 65. You would have to treat 65 patients,
> on average, in order to see one additional case of hypertension. The
> authors mention that this hypertension was temporary, so this seems
> like a side effect well worth tolerating.

> Finasteride has a significant effect on prostate volume, maximum
> urinary flow rate, and symptom scores. These are continuous measures
> and thus are presented as changes in mean scores rather than as NNTs.
> The prostate volume decrease from 43.7 cubic cm to 32.7 in the
> finasteride group, but only from 44.8 to 43.0 in the control group.
> The urinary flow rates increased from 11.2mL/s to 12.5 after 24 months
> in the finasteride group, while they increased only from 10.5 to 11.3
> in the placebo group. Thus the finasteride group had a 0.5 mL/s better
> improvement, on average. At 12 months, the average symptom score was
> 3.7 points lower in the finasteride group compared to a 2.3 point
> decline with placebo. The symptom score, developed by the American
> Urological Association ranges between 0 and 35.

> The authors did show an NNT of 49 and 26 for avoiding acute urinary
> retention at 24 months and at 48 months. The NNTs for avoiding
> prostate surgeries were 31 and 18 for 24 and 48 months, respectively.
> Both acute urinary retention and prostate surgery seem like rather
> extreme events, so these NNTs would still be attractive.

> There were several NNH calculations, as finasteride had an increased

> 47 (decrease libido), 24 (impotence), and 55 (ejaculation disorder).

> Here\'s where some value judgments come into play. How important is it
> to decrease prostate volume and to avoid acute urinary retention and
> surgery? Is the risk of various types of sexual dysfunction worth the
> benefits? The benefits do seem to outweigh the risks to me, but
> different people may come to different conclusions.
