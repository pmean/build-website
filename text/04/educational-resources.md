Someone posed a question on the IRB Discussion forum wondering if there
was a source of free materials "that we can email or distribute as
hardcopy to our study coordinators and other research staff to help them
keep up to date on issues relevant to human subjects research."

There' a lot of good stuff on the web, I wrote back, but you have to
live with uneven quality, partisan viewpoints, and there is no one to
collate and synthesize the results. But then I thought that maybe I
could do this. So as I have time, I'll highlight some of the
interesting developments and controversies in research and provide links
to free sources of information on the web. Here are some examples of
sources that I will draw on.

-   **STATS ([www.stats.org](http://www.stats.org))**. This page is
    published by the Statistical Assessment Service. I'm worried that
    they will come after me because I use the same acronym STATS that
    they do, but as far as I know you cannot copyright an acronym. If
    they complain, I'll change my web page to "A fair and balanced
    look at Statistics." The STATS web site "*monitors the media to
    expose the abuse of science and statistics before people are misled
    and public policy is distorted*" and they do a pretty good job.
    Sometimes they come across as partisan to me, but that may reflect
    my biases rather than theirs. As an example of an interesting recent
    article, see their December 15, 2003 discussion about [hormone
    replacement therapy and the perils of observational
    research](http://www.stats.org/record.jsp?type=news&ID=460). My
    favorite take on this controversy, by the way, was an editorial by
    David Sackett titled "[The arrogance of preventive
    medicine](http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/167/4/363)." I hope
    to write a web page about this controversy myself when I have time.
-   **Junkscience ([www.junkscience.com](http://www.junkscience.com))**.
    This page, published by Steve Milloy, is definitely partisan. He
    scoffs at the purported risks from global warming, environmental
    tobacco smoke, mad cow disease, and so forth. But he knows his
    statistics and is good at uncovering methodological weaknesses in
    various medical and environmental research. I believe he lapses into
    statistical nihilism, where any flaw in the methodology is enough to
    toss out the results. Steve Milloy also writes a regular column for
    the Fox News web site, and you might find a January 30, 2004 article
    about the [controversy over carbohydrates in
    diet](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,109890,00.html) to be
    interesting.
-   **AHRP ([www.ahrp.org](http://www.ahrp.org))**. The Alliance for
    Human Research Protection sends out regular press releases about
    research abuses and provides testimony to government agencies in
    favor of greater research protections. Since AHRP is an advocacy
    group, you won't find too many articles that are complimentary of
    research methodology and I disagree sharply with their criticisms
    about research with children. Perhaps I am conflicted, though,
    because my salary is paid for by a hospital that does research with
    children. A December 7, 2003 press release on [conflict of
    interest](http://www.ahrp.org/infomail/03/12/07.html) highlights
    problems at the National Institute of Health. Conflict of interest
    is such an important area for those of us who perform research, but
    also for those who have to interpret research where the journal
    authors have a conflict.
-   **BioMed Central
    ([www.biomedcentral.com](http://www.biomedcentral.com))**. BioMed
    Central publishes a large number of open access journals with the
    full text available on the web. My favorite journal is BMC Medical
    Research Methodology. Some of these articles are a bit technical,
    but there are also some real gems, such as a December 22, 2003
    article on [pragmatic
    trials](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/3/28).
-   **BMJ ([bmj.bmjjournals.com](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/))**. One of
    the pioneering journals in open access has been the British Medical
    Journal. They will [limit access to
    articles](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/327/7409/241)
    starting January 2005, though, but they would still have a
    wonderful archive going back to the mid 1990's and they would
    still re-open access to published articles six months after the
    publication date. BMJ has always done a nice job of highlighting
    research methodology and their [collected resources
    page](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/collections/) is a nice place to
    explore, with sections on Epidemiology, Ethics, Statistics. A good
    example of research methodology is a January 31, 2004 article on
    [improving self report
    measures](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/328/7434/258).
-   **Bandolier
    ([www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/](http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/))**.
    There are many resources for Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), but
    Bandolier is my favorite. The writing is crisp and clean and they
    have wonderful real world examples. The November 12, 2003 issue has
    an article about [the value of searching skills in
    EBM](http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band117/b117-3.html). While
    you might think that training people how to find the evidence would
    lead to better outcomes, the evidence is actually mixed.

There are many more resources, of course. Send me an email if you have a
favorite.

**An additional educational resource**

Someone else on the IRB Forum listed a [nice educational
resource](http://www.illuminata-inc.com/News.html) from Illuminata. This
web site lists recent news stories about research controversies, such as
a February 1, 2004 report about a [lawsuit from the families of five
patients who died in a controversial medical
experiment](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2001848510_hutch01.html).
The web site describes Illuminata as "*a Seattle-based education and
information services company, providing services and resources in the
areas of human subjects research, ethics, and genetics. We support IRB
professionals, research teams and others through identifying their
information and education requirements and developing tailored products
and services to meet their needs.*"
