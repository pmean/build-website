I got a question from someone in my office who is taking a class on
research methods. She asked me to define the term "Monte Carlo" that
her teacher had used without much of an explanation.

Monte Carlo is a method that studies a problem by repeatedly simulating
the random components of the problem and examining the average result.
It always provides an approximate answer, but if the random components
are accurately specified and if the number of repetitions is large
enough, the accuracy of a Monte Carlo simulation can be quite good.

You should avoid the use of Monte Carlo methods when an exact answer is
available through mathematics (except perhaps, as a learning
experience).
