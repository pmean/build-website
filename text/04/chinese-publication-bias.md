I was browsing a paper by Leonard Leibovici
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=10600974)
about alternative medicine when a [comment by Andrew
Vickers](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/319/7225/1629#6000) in
the eletters section caught my eye. He noted the serious problem of
publication bias in Chinese journals. Apparently, the Chinese journals
almost never publish a negative trial. He cites two sources: Vickers et
al 1998 CCT
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9551280&dopt=Abstract)
and Tang et al 1999 BMJ
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10406751&dopt=Abstract).

I only have the abstract of the Vickers paper, but the numbers quoted
there are astounding. In studies of accupuncture, every single trial
published in China was positive. In areas other than acupuncture, 99% of
the trials were positive.
