You would think that you can never have enough information about your
health. Barring financial considerations, the more testing the better.

That actually is not true. In some situations, too many diagnostic tests
are being run, and it hurts rather than helps the patient. American
Medical News has an article about this

**Lab tests go under a critical microscope Experts point out that good
tests used badly can lead to bad medicine.** Victoria Stagg Elliott.
Nov. 1, 2004.
[www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2004/11/01/hlsd1101.htm](http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2004/11/01/hlsd1101.htm)

They offer several good examples.

-   Dialysis patients will often show abnormal results immediately
    post-dialysis, but these values almost always normalize without
    intervention.
-   A positive herpes test cannot easily distinguish between type 1 and
    type 2 herpes, but a positive result without drawing such
    distinctions could result in serious and unnecessary personal
    difficulties.
-   A slightly abnormal antinuclear antibody test may indicate nothing,
    but patients who surf the Internet may believe that they have lupus
    or another serious disease.

The article suggests ordering specific tests rather than an entire
panel. Why include tests that you know provide no useful information but
which might unduly increase anxiety in your patients?

Gina Kolata wrote an excellent article about the problems with
unnecessary tests for the New York Times (Annual Physical Checkup May Be
an Empty Ritual, August 12, 2003). Most of the tests done at your annual
physical exam have no support in the literature, but patients still
expect these tests. She has a marvelous story about a patient with a
laundry list of tests that she wanted.

I discussed the problems with [whole body scans](FullBodyScan.html),
[pap smears for women without a cervix](PapSmear.html), and [prostate
specific antigen tests](psa.html) in earlier web log entries.

The real reason that people do not appreciate the problems with too many
diagnostic tests is that they do not understand that there are costs
associated with a false positive finding: the preventable anxiety that a
false positive test produces, the cost and risks associated with
additional testing, and sometimes the unnecessary medical treatments
given for those who are falsely labeled as being sick. When the
prevalence of the disease being tested for is low, then this problem is
magnified because the false positives greatly outnumber the false
negatives.
