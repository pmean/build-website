A writer on the [IRB Discussion Forum](http://www.irbforum.org/) asked a
question about how to explain stratified randomization in an informed
consent document.

An example of stratified randomization is to have one randomization
table for men and a separate randomization table for women. Stratified
randomization is an acknowledgement that the randomization process is
not perfect. You would not expect 100 flips of a coin to yield exactly
50 heads and 50 tails, so you should not expect that simple
randomization will lead to perfect covariate balance.

The CONSORT statement has some nice definitions of stratified
randomization and similar methods at
[www.consort-statement.org/table38b.htm](http://www.consort-statement.org/table38b.htm).
If you ever have to create a randomization table yourself, I have a nice
tutorial on the web at
[www.pmean.com/plan/random.asp](../99/random.asp).

controlled trials.** Roberts C, Torgerson DJ. BMJ 1999: 319(7203); 185-.
