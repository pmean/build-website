I received an inquiry from our Institutional Review Board about a study
they were doing a continuing review for. This was a non-randomized
comparison of two surgical techniques.

The first question you might ask is: \"Why didn\'t they randomize the
treatments?\" In general, it is difficult to randomize in a surgery
trial. In a 2002 BMJ article
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12065273&dopt=Abstract),
McCulloch offers a wide range of reasons.

-   Unlike drug trials, there are no large commercial sponsors of
    surgical research.
-   Emergency surgery often makes consent and randomization impossible.
-   Many surgical techniques are rare and cannot accumulate sufficient
    sample sizes.
-   The learning curve for new techniques make it impractical two
    different surgical methods in the same practice.
-   Outcomes may be more strongly related to the skill of the particular
    surgeon rather than the technique used.
-   Variations in an operation may occur during the operation itself and
    these variations can often influence the outcome.
-   While it is possible to monitor the purity of a drug, it is
    difficult to assess the technical quality of an operation.
-   Patients may be unwilling to allow randomization to choose the type
    of surgery they will receive.

This last point was also emphasized in a 1994 World J Surg article
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=7975698&dopt=Abstract),
where Plaisier noted that most patients did not want to participate in a
randomized study of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy with open
cholecystectomy, and that a newer technique, laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, was so popular that it would probably be impossible to
ever run a randomized trial for this surgery.<U+FFFD>

In a 1984 NEJM article
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=6717508),
Taylor noticed poor enrollment in a randomized comparison of mastectomy
approaches and asked physicians why. Some of the reasons offered
included:

> *(1) concern that the doctor-patient relationship would be affected by
> a randomized clinical trial (73 per cent);\
> (2) difficulty with informed consent (38 per cent);\
> (3) dislike of open discussions involving uncertainty (22 per cent);\
> (4) perceived conflict between the roles of scientist and clinician
> (18 per cent);\
> (5) practical difficulties in following procedures (9 per cent); and\
> (6) feelings of personal responsibility if the treatments were found
> to be unequal (8 per cent).*

In a 1995 BMJ editorial
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=7496220),
Russell argues that most of the constraints on randomization in surgical
trials can be overcome with sufficient effort.

The use of placebos in randomized trials of surgery is extremely
controversial. I talk about this at length on [my page about
placebos](../plan/placebo.asp), and will not repeat the discussion here.

Lots of other areas of medicine have trouble with recruiting patients
for randomized trials (would you volunteer for a randomized trial of
birth control methods, especially if you knew that one of the arms of
the study was a placebo arm?). Still, the problems are thoughtfully
documented for surgery trials, and this offers us a good example on some
of the constraints on randomization.
