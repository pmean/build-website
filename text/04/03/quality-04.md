**[StATS]: Quality control in the laboratory
(created 2004-03-09)**.

> I\'ll be giving a talk at the [American Society for
> Andrology](http://www.andrologysociety.com/default.asp) in April about
> the [use of quality control for sperm morphology
> assessments](http://www.andrologysociety.com/meetings/alw.program.asp).
> I\'ll put some of my notes up on the web when I get the chance. The
> [National Institute of Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov/)
> has a nice [engineering statistics
> handbook](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm) with a
> whole chapter on [process or product monitoring and
> control](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/pmc.htm).
>
> Sperm morphology is a classification system. I\'ve found that the
> concept of entropy is useful in understanding ambiguities in
> classification systems, and I\'ve started a web page [about
> entropy](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/entropy.htm).
