**[StATS]: Microarray data analysis (March 18,
2004)**.

> The large amount of data is a typical DNA microarray assays makes for
> a lot of challenges for us statisticians. I\'ve wanted to write a
> simple introductory web page on this topic for a while, but have never
> found the time to do it well. There are a couple of recent articles on
> microarrays published on BioMed Central with full text available on
> line. The first, [The Limits of Log-Ratios by Sharov et
> al](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/4/3/abstract), points out
> that there are mathematical constraints on the Ratio-Intensity plot
> and that if your data bumps up against these constraints, you may see
> some artefactual patterns in the plot. The second, [Universal
> Reference RNA as a standard for microarray experiments by
> Novoradovskaya et
> al](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/20/abstract), develops a
> reference standard useful \"for monitoring and controlling intra- and
> inter-experimental variation.\" These articles are too recent to have
> appeared in Medline yet. An earlier article about universal reference
> RNA samples is also worth mentioning.
