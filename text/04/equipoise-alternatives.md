> Stephen Senn wrote an interesting article a couple of years ago that
> provides an intriguing alternative to the concept of equipoise. I
> wrote about equipoise in a web page discussing [the ethics of placebo
> controlled trials](../plan/placebo.asp). The concept of equipoise
> actually extends well beyond placebo controlled trials, but it is in
> those trials that the concept is most easily understood.

> Dr. Senn argues that society has a vested interest in studying new
> drugs and therapies in a rigorous fashion, and asks that patients
> sacrifice some degree of choice in order to conduct these studies
> efficiently. In particular, some untested or unproven drugs might be
> available only through randomized trials until enough information is
> accumulated either to make the drug available to the general public or
> to reject the drug out of hand and study it no further.

> Since society has mandated that certain drugs are only available

> the benefit of the best available therapy outside the trial?

> This is a less rigorous standard than equipoise which would mandate
> that not only would the expected benefit of participating in the trial
> have to be better, but that the two arms being randomized in the trial
> had to roughly comparable. Dr. Senn argues that a physician who would
> refuse to enroll a patient in a study without equipoise, but with the
> expected benefit being superior to the best available therapy outside
> the trial is automatically condemning 100% of his patients to an
> inferior treatment.

> Good food for thought. In discussions with researchers planning
> studies with placebos, I had argued a similar standard, but not quite
> the same. In order to get volunteers to agree to be in your study
> (admittedly a more pragmatic concern than the ethical concerns
> discussed above), you need to make sure that both arms of the study
> are superior to the standard of care your patients would get outside
> the trial.

> One question still remains. Is it ethical for society to restrict the
> use of promising new drugs to the confines of a clinical trial? Dr.
> Senn argues that it is, and cites an approach developed by John Rawls.
