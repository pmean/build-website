Someone on the IRBForum posed a theoretical question. Is running a three
arm study troublesome from an ethical viewpoint because the probability
that any subject in the trial receives the best possible treatment
decreases from 50% to 33%?

The key thing to remember is that any randomized trial requires
equipoise in order to be ethical. There are conflicting definitions of
equipoise, but most definitions center around the concept that there is
genuine uncertainty about which treatment is best. You can, for example,
only use a [placebo](../01/placebo.html) in a randomized trial if you
are unsure whether the new treatment is better than the placebo.

If there was equipoise at the start of the trial, then the probability
of receiving benefit does not change with the number of arms. Keep in
mind that a two-arm study that excludes the only arm that ends up as
effective would reduce the chances of receiving benefit to zero. Or if
two arms are effective, then the chances of receiving benefit increase
from 50% to 67% in a three arm trial. These scenarios end up balancing
out the negative scenarios such as decreasing the probability from 50%
to 33%.

If this is more than just a theoretical musing, perhaps you should
investigate a concept known as adaptive randomization, where the chances
of receiving a specific treatment increase or decrease during a trial to
reflect the partial information that accumulates during the trial
itself. Adaptive randomization does indeed reduce the chances that
patients in a trial will end up receiving the inferior treatment.
