I attended a lunch roundtable session on the role of statisticians in
teaching Evidence-Based practice to future clinicians. I didn't get a
chance to write up a summary of this, but I wanted to share a handout
that the roundtable leader, Renee Stolove, shared with the group.

The top six mistakes we've made or seen in teaching EBM.

1.  Teaching learners how to do research (rather than how to *use* it).
2.  Teaching learners how to *perform* statistical analyses (rather than
    how to *interpret* them).
3.  Teaching a pre-set series of content topics (rather than have
    content determined by patients' problems).
4.  Evaluating learners on the basis of their retention of facts (rather
    than their skills in obtaining, appraising, and applying "facts"
    to patients).
5.  Striving for closure by the end of every session (rather than
    leaving plenty to think about between sessions).
6.  Assuming that the necessary skills can be taught in Statistics,
    Research, or EBP courses alone.
