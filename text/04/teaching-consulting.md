Most training programs in Statistics do a good job in emphasizing the
various tools that you will need, but it is much harder to teach the
nonstatistical aspects of statistical consulting.

There is a Statistical Consulting Section in the American Statistical
Association and they maintain a nice web site at
[www.amstat.org/sections/cnsl](http://www.amstat.org/sections/cnsl).

Many Universities offer a Statistical Consulting Center. The [University
of Iowa's site](http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/scc/) is a good model.
Graduate students in Statistics consult under the guidance of a
Statistics faculty member with graduate students in other areas who need
help with the statistical aspects of their thesis or dissertation work.
It's great experience for the Statistics students and provides a
valuable service to the other programs at the University.

Here are some books on Statistical Consulting. I have not read any of
these, except for Boen and Zahn.

    Consulting.** (ISBN: 0534979491) [\[BookFinder4U

There is a listserv, stat-l, and a newsgroup, sci.stat.consult, that
offer a forum for discussing consulting issues. The listserv and the
newsgroup used to be linked, but now they function pretty much
independently. More information about stat-l is available on my web
pages under [question 1](../faq/faq01.asp) and [question
4](../faq/faq04.asp) of the [stat-l/sci.stat.consult
FAQ](../faq/faq.asp).
