Someone asked an interesting question on the IRBForum today. Under what
circumstances should the blinding for a trial be broken when an
unexpected Serious Adverse Event (SAE) occurs? The questioner did
mention the [International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)
guidelines](http://www.ich.org) which read as follows:

> *When the sponsor and investigator are blinded to individual patient
> treatment (as in a double-blind study), the occurrence of a serious
> event requires a decision on whether to open (break) the code for the
> specific patient. If the investigator breaks the blind, then it is
> assumed the sponsor will also know the assigned treatment for that
> patient. Although it is advantageous to retain the blind for all
> patients prior to final study analysis, when a serious adverse
> reaction is judged reportable on an expedited basis, it is recommended
> that the blind be broken only for that specific patient by the sponsor
> even if the investigator has not broken the blind. It is also
> recommended that, when possible and appropriate, the blind be
> maintained for those persons, such as biometrics personnel,
> responsible for analysis and interpretation of results at the study's
> conclusion.*

> *There are several disadvantages to maintaining the blind under the

This is excellent advice. In particular, I support their comment about
how breaking the blind for a single patient usually doesn't have any
significant implications on the scientific validity of the study.
Sometimes researchers get hung up over running the "perfect" research
study and let that unduly interfere with other important considerations.

Another consideration is that the research subjects themselves should
have the option of breaking the blind. For example, a research subject
is about to undergo an unexpected surgery and needs to know about the
drug being administered in the clinical trial because one of the two
drugs being studied thins out the blood and increases the risk of the
operation.

You don't want to break the blind for any old reason, but if the
patient has a legitimate reason to know, we should respect that.
Patients who volunteer for a research study cede a lot of their autonomy
when they join. They let a random flip of the coin decide which
treatment they get and in most cases, they are kept in the dark about
that treatment they get until the study is over. There are good reasons
why we ask patients to sacrifice this much autonomy, but we should
recognize that it is indeed a sacrifice and we should respectfully
return that autonomy early to the patient when there is a good medical
justification.

In a perfect world, the rules under which the blinding might be broken
should be specified in the research protocol.

A final consideration is that any data safety and monitoring board
should have access to unblinded data, especially in trials where SAEs
occur frequently.
