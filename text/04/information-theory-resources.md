I received a few suggestions for interesting web sites today. They deal
with information theory and trying to establish causation.

Jan Kahre has written a book, The Mathematical Theory of Information
[\[BookFinder4U
link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/1402070640.html). A [web page
promoting this book](http://www.matheory.info/) includes the first
chapter, references and other resources. This book defines the Law of
Diminishing Information, and applies the concept to medicine, biology,
engineering, and physics.

Jan Hajek has [several papers](http://webm91e7.im1.net/hajek/) related
to causation, information theory, and other interesting topics.

I had previously written about [information theory](information.html) on
this weblog, and I have a [simple
definition](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/entropy.htm) and a [more
elaborate discussion](../model/InfoModel.htm) elsewhere on this website.

You can find an [earlier version](http://www.pmean.com/04/information1.html) of this page on my [original website](http://www.pmean.com/original_site.html).
