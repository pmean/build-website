One of the nine criteria that Sir Austin Bradford Hill offers to
establish a cause and effect relationship is temporality. In order for A
to cause B, A must precede B in time. That seems logical enough, but
every once in a while, you find someone who ignores temporality.

The classic joke along these lines was a statistician who was studying
fire department records and concluded that the more fire engines you
sent to a fire, the more damage they caused.

When scientists were first establishing that smoking causes lung cancer,
some people offered the counter argument that cancer causes smoking.
It's a difficult argument to make, but it was put forth with perfect
seriousness. We all know that smoking preceded cancer, usually by
several decades of time. The argument was that there were genetic
tendencies towards cancer and perhaps these same tendencies also were
related to the tendency to become addicted to nicotine. It's pretty
easy to demolish this argument, of course.

Victor Stenger highlights another example in [an
article](http://www.csicop.org/sb/2004-03/reality-check.html) in the
March 2004 issue of Skeptical Briefs. There was a cute article in the
2001 year end issue of the British Medical Journal titled: "Beyond
Science? Effects of remote, retroactive intercessory prayer on outcomes
in patients with bloodstream infection: randomized controlled trial."
([\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&db=pubmed&list_uids=11751349&dopt=Abstract)).
The author, Leonard Leibovici, found the records of 3,393 adult patients
with bloodstream infection at Rabin Medical Center, randomly divided
those records into two groups then randomly selected one group to pray
over. Note that this is a RETROSPECTIVE study. The outcomes were
determined 4 to 10 years prior to the start of the study. After praying
over one group, the author evaluated mortality, stay in the hospital,
and duration of fever. Although there was no statistically significant
difference in mortality (p=0.40), there was a reduction in the length of
stay (p=0.01) and in duration of fever (p=0.04).

It is dangerous to speculate on the motives of the author, but this
article was published in a year end issue that is traditionally reserved
for light hearted articles.

Brian Olshansky and Larry Dossey treated the paper with quite a bit more
seriousness, and in [an
article](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/327/7429/1465) in
the December 20, 2003 issue of BMJ argue for various physical mechanisms
that could explain this result. They first argue that our understanding
of how the world truly works is incomplete. For example, there is a
classic result in physics where particles separated by vast distances of
space can influence one another. There is no good explanation for how
this occurs, therefore we shouldn't be too upset if there is no good
explanation for how retrospective prayer would work.

They then cite obscure theoretical models in physics (bosonic string
quantum mechanics and Calabi-Yau space) and research at the Institute of
Transpersonal Psychology and the William James Center for Consciousness
Studies that show retroactive influences in 10 out of a series of 19
experiments.

In my opinion, Olshansky and Dossey are making much too big a fuss about
an article that was not intended to be serious research. This article
was published in the same spirit as the Canadian Medical Association
article, Celestial Determinants of Success in Research
([\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11841004&dopt=Abstract)),
that demonstrated an association between certain Zodiac signs and the
likelihood of having received the Nobel Prize in Medicine and
Physiology. Rather than demonstrating the validity of Astrology, this
article was intended to illustrate that

> *foraging through databases, using contrived study designs in the
> absence of biological mechanistic data, sometimes yields spurious
> results.*

The Leibovici article was clearly an effort to show the limitations of
research methods by an example where a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
shows a result that is truly bizarre. The results of this study should
force us to confront the weaknesses of the RCT rather than the
limitations of bosonic string quantum mechanics.

Furthermore, Olshansky and Dossey ignore a far simpler explanation of
the unusual results: fraud. I have no reason to believe that Leonard
Leibovici would manufacture these findings for personal gain, but quite
frankly, the field of paranormal research, as a whole, has a quite
troubling reputation for fraudulent claims. For that matter, the field
of medicine has a quite troubling reputation for fraudulent claims. I
recently received a recommendation for a book, **Betrayers of the
Truth** by William Broad and Nicholas Wade that highlights that research
fraud is a pervasive problem.

The best protection against fraud, of course, is replication by an
independent group. This replication has not been done, perhaps because
most people recognized that the Leibovici article was not intended to be
serious research.

Olshansky and Dossey call on all of us to be open minded about the
possibility of retrospective effects of prayer. But if they are willing
to abandon commonly accepted principles about the temporality of causes
and effects, without first asking for independent replication of this
unusual result, perhaps they themselves are being a bit too open minded.

Some additional comments about the retrospective prayer article are
worth noting. In the [Rapid Response
e-letters](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/323/7327/1450)
section of BMJ, Martin Bland raised the ethical issue of treating the
control group.

> *According to Clause 30 of the latest revision of the Declaration of
> Helsinki: At the conclusion of the study, every patient entered into
> the study should be assured of access to the best proven prophylactic,
> diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by the study. To meet
> this ethical standard, the prayer should now be said for the control
> group. If the treatment is effective, this should have the effect of
> removing the difference between the groups. I await the results with
> interest.*

In separate e-letters, Eugenio Pucci and Christopher Price raise a
different issue: informed consent. The author did not ask consent from
the patients before conducting this experiment. Consent is often waived
in retrospective studies because the research would otherwise be
impractical. Surprisingly, informed consent has been waived for most
PROSPECTIVE studies of prayer, where consent is actually quite easy to
obtain. The rationale for waiving informed consent was to avoid
volunteer bias, and perhaps this was also tempered by the belief that
most people would not be offended at the thought of prayers being
offered on their behalf.

As another aside, I was involved with a similar study (prospective, not
retrospective). We planned this study using a one-sided hypothesis
(remote prayer has a positive effect on health). The Institutional
Review Board suggested changing this to a two-sided hypothesis (remote
prayer has either a positive or a negative effect on health).
Thankfully, we did not observe an outcome in the opposite tail as that
would have been very difficult to explain.
