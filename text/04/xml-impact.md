XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is standard for sorting information
that has the flexibility needed to handle complex data. It is similar to
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) in that it uses tags to denote
information. It is a simple text file which means that you can use a
text editor to view the raw data. Although this may not be the most
efficient way to look at an XML file, this allows you to peek at the
information in any XML file without any special software. There are
three areas that show how useful XML is for Statistics:

**1. MathML**. MathML is a joint standard for displaying mathematical
equations. It allows you to import equations written in this format to
your own mathematics program where you can plug in values for the
variables or otherwise manipulate the data.

**2. Scalable Vector Graphics**. Scalable Vector Graphs is another
standard for displaying graphs and images. With the right software, you
can manipulate images that others have produced.

**3. mageML**. MageML (Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression Markup
Language) is a standard for storing information from a microarray
experiment. It stores all the complex information from a microarray
experiment in a single self-documenting package.
