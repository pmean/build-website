> Several people on the IRBForum have made comments along the lines that

> An argument can (and should) be made that this is a poor use of scarce
> resources. There are many more promising therapies than homeopathy
> that have gone untested, so a study of homeopathy diverts money from

> Finally, if a therapy is currently widespread but without any
