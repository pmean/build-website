**[StATS]: Research on therapies that have no known
mechanism of action (November 4, 2004)**.

> Several people on the IRBForum have made comments along the lines that
> research on certain alternative medicines (such as homeopathy) has no
> scientific merit because there is no known mechanism by which these
> therapies can work. Since there is no scientific merit, there is no
> balance between the risks and benefits. This leads directly to a
> conclusion that it is unethical to conduct a study on these
> alternative therapies.
>
> An argument can (and should) be made that this is a poor use of scarce
> resources. There are many more promising therapies than homeopathy
> that have gone untested, so a study of homeopathy diverts money from
> these more promising alternatives. But to say that investigations of
> therapies with no known mechanism of action are always unethical is
> perhaps a bit too extreme.
>
> First, such an argument is paternalistic. It presumes that the
> researcher always knows what is in the best interest of the patient
> and the researcher alone decides what risks a patient should be
> willing to endure. Many of these alternative therapies are currently
> being embraced by thousands of people and who are we to tell them that
> they should not endure in a research setting something that they
> routinely seek out for their daily care?
>
> **Paternalism or partnership? Patients have grown up-and there\'s no
> going back.** Coulter A. Bmj 1999: 319(7212); 719-20.

> Second, the concept of mechanism is somewhat subjective. Often you can
> find a mechanistic explanation for why a certain exposure might
> increase your risk of disease and a competing mechanistic explanation
> for why a certain exposure might decrease your risk of disease. It
> also depends on what your current beliefs are. Someone who believes in
> the concept of Qi will be able to postulate mechanisms for all sorts
> of alternative medicines. Someone who believes in God will have no
> problem with a mechanism for prayer studies. The mechanistic
> explanations that you are willing to accept for intellectual
> development will vary depending on whether you believe that IQ is
> determined entirely by your genes, entirely by your environment, or
> some mixture. For that matter, the mechanisms that you will accept
> depend on whether you believe that intelligence is a single
> dimensional construct that we can measure validly.
>
> Third, some therapies have been adopted prior to the identification of
> a mechanism of action. Only later was a mechanism discovered. I don\'t
> have any specific examples, but I\'m sure that some readers will
> provide me with good examples.
>
> Fourth, presence of a mechanism should be only one of several
> considerations being evaluated to gauge scientific merit. You might
> also want to consider whether there is any animal data to support the
> use of a certain therapy. Animal models are imperfect, but they do
> prove useful in preventing many totally hopeless therapies from being
> tested on humans. Is there credible observational data to support an
> alternative therapy? Observational data is also imperfect, especially
> in an area like alternative medicine where there is a lot of
> enthusiasm among proponents. But credible observational data makes the
> case for developing good randomized studies all the more compelling.
>
> Finally, if a therapy is currently widespread but without any
> scientific basis, then a research study will still have merit if it
> produces convincing evidence to discourage the use of this valueless
> therapy.
>
> The bottom line is that having a mechanism for a therapy strengthens
> the scientific merit, but absence of a mechanism does not imply that
> the research is wholly without merit.
