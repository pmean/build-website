**[StATS]: Confidence intervals for complex research
designs (November 5, 2004)**

> Someone asked me by email about confidence intervals in complex
> research designs. This person had rejected the use of [post hoc power
> calculations](../size/posthoc.asp), and wanted instead to use
> confidence intervals to help answer the question about whether the
> sample size was adequate. In a simple setting, such as the comparison
> of a treatment group to a control group, the choice of confidence
> interval is obvious, but how would you handle complex research designs
> (more than two groups and/or repeated measurements over time).
>
> For example, if you are comparing a low, medium, and high dose to a
> placebo, then three confidence intervals for the difference between
> each dose and placebo might be interesting. If there is no dose
> response pattern, then a confidence interval comparing the two extreme
> doses might be helpful because it places limits on the size of any
> possible dose response pattern.
>
> If your repeated measures include a baseline, 6 month and 12 month
> measures, then a confidence interval for the short term change (6
> month minus baseline) and an interval for the long term change (12
> month minus baseline) might be useful. Combining the two scenarios
> together, perhaps you know there is a strong placebo response, so then
> you might want a confidence interval for the long term change score
> between each dose and the placebo.
>
> If you end up with more than two or three confidence intervals, you
> might want to consider some sort of adjustment like
> [Bonferroni](../ask/bonferroni.asp).
