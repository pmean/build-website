While browsing through the archives of the British Medical Journal, I
noticed an excellent article on measuring heterogeneity in
meta-analysis. There is a new measure, I-squared, that measures the
proportion of inconsistency in individual studies that cannot be
explained by chance. It ranges between 0% and 100% with lower values
representing less heterogeneity.

This measure is preferred to the traditional test statistic, Cochran\'s
Q. The problem with Cochran\'s Q, the authors claim, is that it tends to
have too little power with a collection of studies with small sample
sizes and too much power with a collection of studies with large sample
sizes.

They also provide an informal categorization of I-squared, with values
of 25%, 50%, and 75% representing low, moderate, and high heterogeneity.
