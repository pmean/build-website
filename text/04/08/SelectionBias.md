**[StATS]: Selection bias (created 2004-08-24)**.

The [CarTalk radio show](http://www.cartalk.com/index.html) has an
interesting puzzle every week and often these puzzles involve
mathematics. These puzzles can sometimes help you understand complex
mathematical concepts that are important in Statistics. In the summer,
they re-use puzzlers from earlier years, and just last week, they
re-used one of my favorites. A \"nameless mathematician\" during World
War II was asked to help with a military problem. A lot of bombers were
not returning from their missions, so the Royal Air Force wanted to put
armor on the bombers. But where to put it? They couldn\'t put it
everywhere because it would be too heavy. So this mathematician looked
at the planes that returned and noted where they had holes from enemy
fire. These holes were distributed more or less randomly throughout the
plane except for two regions where there were nothing. His
recommendation was to place the armor only in those two areas where no
enemy fire was found. This seems counterintuitive, which is why it makes
such a good puzzle.

This mathematician hypothesized that any plane hit in those regions did
not survive to return. The other areas could be hit and the plane could
still limp back to safety. This is an example of selection bias. The
bombers in the study were not a random sample of all bombers, they were
a sample of bombers that returned safely.

This case was actually discussed in a delightful article in Chance
magazine (see below). That article gives the name of the mathematician
(Abraham Wald) and a few more details on the logic behind this choice.
It has several other amusing examples of selection bias, such as the
average age of death among various professions. The profession that had
the worst result, with an average age at death of only 20.7 years was
\"student\".

An excellent book by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves also has a delightful
story about selection bias.
