**[StATS]: Statistical software (August 25, 2004).**

> Back when I was writing the [FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for
> stat-l/sci.stat.consult](../faq.asp), I had a question about [how to
> contact commercial statistical software vendors](../faq/faq08.asp) and
> [where to find free statistical software](../faq/faq09.asp).
> Unfortunately, stat-l has fallen on hard times, so I have not updated
> this FAQ for several years. But I do want to convert those two lists
> to a different part of my web pages and update them.
>
> I got an email from Muthen and Muthen, makers of Mplus, and I will add
> this software program to the list when I have time. According to this
> company:
>
> > *Mplus is a comprehensive modeling program that integrates random
> > effect, factor, and latent class analysis in both cross-sectional
> > and longitudinal settings and for both single-level and multi-level
> > data.* \--

> I have not used this software, so I can\'t endorse it. Even for the
> software I do use, I wouldn\'t want to endorse any of it. Statistical
> software is such an individual thing that it is impossible for a
> stranger like me to recommend any particular program to you. For the
> record, though, here is the software that I do use, in alphabetical
> order.
