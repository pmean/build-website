**[StATS]: Surromed and the DecisionSite S-Plus
Server Solution (December 8, 2004)**

Keith Joho from Surromed, Michael O\'Connell from Insightful and Ed
Tobin from Spotfire presented a web seminar on Suromed and the
DecisionSite S-Plus Server Solution.

Spotfire\'s DecisionSite software provides interactive visualization and
guided data analysis useful for the average scientist. S-plus provides
ihhg qulaity well tested statistical and graphical functions. Using the
S-plus server to link to DecisionSite, you can get the best of both
worlds. This seminar showed a simple example using analysis of variance
for microarray data. They also outlined how this system can be used to
search for biomarkers.

These systems used
[SOAP](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part0-20030624/), an XML
standard for exchange of structured information between applications in
a decentralized computing environment. This is another example of [how
XML is revolutionizing the practice of Statistics](xml.html).
