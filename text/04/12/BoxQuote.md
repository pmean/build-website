**[StATS]: Interesting quote: Hiring a
statistician\... (December 20, 2004)**.

> *\"Hiring a statistician after the data has been collected is like
> hiring a physician when your patient is in the morgue. He might be
> able to tell you what went wrong, but he is unlikely to be able to fix
> it.\"* George Box, as cited on the EDSTAT-L email discussion group.
