**[StATS]: Prayer studies (December 13, 2004)**.

> I\'ve been meaning to write a web page about the series of studies
> that seem to indicate that groups of patients receiving prayer get
> better health outcomes than the control group. It is an interesting
> series of studies because it illustrates some of the difficulties,
> even with randomized double blind trials.
>
> It also raises some interesting theological questions, and although I
> am not an expert on theology, I find those arguments interesting also.
>
> But there is a third line of thought which argues that research in
> this area is logically flawed. Bob Carroll, author of the Skeptic\'s
> Dictionary [\[BookFinder4U
> link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0471272426.html), says that
> research should be confined only to processes which obey the natural
> laws of science.
>
> > *If prayer works by influencing God to influence the outcome of an
> > experiment, then God can interfere with the laws of nature at any
> > time. If God can interfere with the laws of nature at any time, then
> > no controlled, double-blind study can be sure of the meaning of
> > whatever outcome results. Any result could be the result of direct
> > influence by God. In other words, the assumption the study is based
> > on is self-defeating. No science at all would be possible if God
> > could be interfering with the laws of nature at will. Science
> > requires a backdrop of lawfulness in Nature in order to discover any
> > causal connection between anything and anything else.* \--
