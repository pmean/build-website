I got another question, this one from Brooklyn, New York. It\'s a
commonly asked question, so I should write something about this. The
question is whether you can get a correlation coefficient between two
variables when one (or both) are categorical.

It turns out that you can do this, as long as the categorical variable
is binary (has only two levels). It\'s easiest to follow this if you
code the variable as 0-1, but it turns out that how you code the
variable doesn\'t really matter much. I\'ll show the math when I have
time, but you can also see this on a variety of web sites:
