There's a new journal out with free full text on the web. It is
[Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative
Medicine](http://ecam.oupjournals.org/) and is published by Oxford
Journals online. I find that CAM makes for interesting teaching examples
because students are willing to be extra skeptical for these studies and
don't passively and uncritically accept the findings on CAM research.

I had previously raised the issue of randomized controlled trials (RCT)
and CAM. Some of the criticisms of RCTs by CAM proponents are on the
mark and these same weaknesses make RCTs a poor method for evaluating
complex interventions. Some of the criticisms, however, are unwarranted,
and the RCT can often provide solid evidence of the lack of efficacy in
certain CAM approaches in spite of its weaknesses.

This journal looks like it has a lot of promise and may provide me with
lots of new teaching examples for the future.

**Disclaimer.** I am working with Oxford University Press on a book, so
I am predisposed to say nice things about them.
