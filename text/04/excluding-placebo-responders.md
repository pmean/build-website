I've always been fascinated by the [placebo
effect](../plan/placebo.asp) and the ethical issues associated with use
of placebos in research.

A correspondent in the IRBForum email discussion group asked about the
recent efforts of drug companies to identify patients who are likely to
show a placebo effect and then exclude them from randomized trials. Here
are some excerpts from a June 18 article in the Wall Street Journal (I
couldn't get free access to this article on the web).

This is a classic example of the tension between internal validity and
external validity. Heterogeneity in the study population leads to a loss
in precision. So drug companies, in an effort to show efficacy in the
most economical way possible, want a nice homogenous sample.

This isn't just with regards to placebo responders. They want a sample
where everyone complies with the medication. After all, it's hard to
show efficacy in a population where half the people forget to take their
pills.

They also try to exclude troublesome patients, patients with comorbid
conditions or who are taking other medications that might interfere with
the drug being studied. This often leads, by the way, to an unfair
exclusion of elderly patients from studies even though they are often
the target market for the drugs being studied. Older patients are almost
always going to have several things go wrong with them at once, and they
are the ones with frequent flier cards at the local pharmacy.

Once you get a nice squeaky clean sample, all is well and good for that
particular comparison, but can you really extrapolate the results to
patients that you would normally see in your practice? Do you have the
option of saying "I won't treat you because I think that you are
unlikely to take the prescriptions as directed"? Can you refuse to
treat a patient unless they have only the one illness that you are
trying to treat?

It seems to me that you should probably start with a nice clean sample
and exclude all those troublemakers. After all, if you can't show an
effect in a small trial with a clean sample, what's the point in
running a larger pragmatic trial?

Of course, when the small trial with a clean sample shows up
significant, you still need to look at the larger trial with a more
heterogenous population.

By the way, I get nervous when people try to hitch their wagon to the so
called placebo effect. I don't think these drug companies will have
much effect in excluding placebo responders. In many studies the placebo
effect is intermingled with other effects, such as the tendency for some
diseases to resolve spontaneously. What's the old saying\--if you
don't get treatment for your cold it will last for seven days, but if
you treat it aggressively it will be gone in a week.

Other effects like the cyclical nature of some diseases and the
regression to the mean would not disappear when placebo responders were
excluded. The placebo effect might also just be the greater level of
care and attention that patients get in a randomized clinical trial.
Just getting someone to visit a doctor regularly will probably help that
person's health in a lot of small ways.

I attended a talk about hypnotherapy and I asked the speaker afterwards
about the placebo effect. He argued that the effect of hypnotism WAS the
placebo effect, because the placebo effect was the mind's ability to
control the body. I guess he wasn't familiar with the Hrobjartsson and
Gotzsche review in the 2001 NEJM that showed that the placebo effect
was, for the most part, no different than an unblinded "no treatment"
arm.
