I have always found the concept of software patents confusing. I am
listed as a co-inventor on a software patent, so perhaps that raises a
conflict of interest. Still, here is my best understanding of the issue.

For anything to be patented, it has to be new, useful, and not obvious.
Also, you cannot patent a business process or a mathematical algorithm.
If the business process or algorithm, though, is incorporated into a
system that relates to concrete, real world values, that that system is
patentable.

Several recent examples of software patents show the complexity of this
issue:

**Amazon** files a patent in 1997 for the concept of One Click shopping
where a customer enters their credit card number just once and the can
place multiple product orders in the future with a single click of the
mouse. They sued and prevailed over a competitor, Barnesandnoble that
offered an "Express Lane" for their customers, that also stored a
credit card number once and allowed customers to place multiple orders
under that credit card.

**Microsoft** has applied for a patent for the IsNot operator in BASIC.
This is

> *A system, method and computer-readable medium support the use of a
> single operator that allows a comparison of two variables to determine
> if the two variables point to the same location in memory.*

Apparently, this improvement on the construction

> *Not (a Is b)*

is sufficiently original to warrant a patent.
