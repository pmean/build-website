**[StATS]: Conflict of interest (July 20, 2004)**.

Does having a commercial interest in the results of a drug trial cause a
problem for the people running the trial? If it does, then much of the
research that we rely on could be flawed. A recent article in the
British Medical Journal raises some serious concerns.

The [eletters section of this
paper](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/328/7444/879) is
fascinating as various authors argue back and forth about the quality of
the evidence.

The use of antidepressants in children is fraught with controversy. The
Association for Human Research Protection
([www.ahrp.org](http://www.ahrp.org)) has issued some stinging
criticisms of the pharmaceutical industry that are well worth reading.

As I noted in my June 25 entry, Eliot Spitzer, the New York Attorney
General, has sued a major pharmaceutical company for failing to properly
report adverse events and negative trials.

When a [potential conflict of interest](conflict.html) is brought to
your attention, you need to approach the research cautiously, and you
should rightly demand extra evidence. Don\'t turn into a statistical
nihilist, though, and disregard any research with a potential conflict
of interest.

What the recent findings about anti-depressants do show is that perhaps
our skeptical signal detector ought to be on at full power when there is
a commercial interest involved.
