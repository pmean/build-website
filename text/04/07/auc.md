**[StATS]: Evaluating the AUC for an ROC curve (July
27, 2004)**.

> Someone asked me where I got the following guidance for Area Under the
> Curve (AUC) for a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
>
> -   0.50 to 0.75 = fair
> -   0.75 to 0.92 = good
> -   0.92 to 0.97 = very good
> -   0.97 to 1.00 = excellent.
>
> I cannot find where I got these numbers. It must be a sign of senility
> on my part. I\'ll keep looking, but if anyone else knows of
> justification for this or any other rule, let me know.
>
> I did find a web page
> ([gim.unmc.edu/dxtests/roc3.htm](http://gim.unmc.edu/dxtests/roc3.htm))
> that suggested this rule
>
> -   .90-1 = excellent (A)
> -   .80-.90 = good (B)
> -   .70-.80 = fair (C)
> -   .60-.70 = poor (D)
> -   .50-.60 = fail (F)
>
> but the evenness of the intervals strikes me as rather arbitrary.
> I\'ll keep looking.
