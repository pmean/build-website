**[StATS]: Planning a qualitative research study
(July 6, 2004).**

> Someone asked me for some specific advice on how to design a
> qualitative study. I love qualitative research. I think people should
> be using this mode of research more often. But I have to admit that I
> have little first hand experience in this area. I can make some
> general comments but no specific recommendations.

> First of all, what is a qualitative study? A qualitative study is a
> study that uses information that is not easily quantifiable. Your data
> may come as a focus group transcript, an open-ended questionnaire, or
> anthropological observations. I have an [amusing example of the
> contrast between qualitative and quantitative
> data](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/qual.htm) that I found in
> Denise Polit\'s book, **Data Analysis and Statistics for Nursing
> Research** [\[BookFinder4U

> Qualitative data gives you a richer picture of what is really going on
> and it is ideal for addressing complex topics where you may not know
> enough to fully delineate a quantitative research study.

> and critical evaluation).
