When a study a placebo controlled study is completed, patients in both
arms of the study are often offered the active drug at the end of the
study at no cost as a way of thanking them for their participation. But
some researchers want to continue to measure long term outcomes
(outcomes that extend beyond the placebo phase of the study), so they
will not reveal to the patients whether they received the active
medication or placebo. This raises some difficult ethical issues. Here
are a few references on this controversy that I saw on the IRBForum.
