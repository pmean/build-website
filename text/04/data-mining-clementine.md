I attended an SPSS web seminar about their Clementine program, which
performs data mining. The talk was oriented to business applications,
but still had some interesting general insights. The speaker started
with the claim that projects that incorporated data mining technologies
had a much greater return on investment than other projects. \--

Data mining is not really new. Anytime people use information about the
world to draw conclusions, you can argue that they are data mining.
Typically, though, data mining is reserved for situations where the
number of data observations are large.

Data mining is used to

-   predict category membership or a numeric value,
-   group or cluster things together than have similar characteristics,
-   associate events that occur together or in a sequence,
-   find outliers that don't fit ordinary patterns or expected
    behavior.

The first two bullets represent [supervised
learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) and
[unsupervised
learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning), and when
I have time I want to document some of the approaches used for
[supervised](../model/arraySupervisedLearning.htm) and
[unsupervised](../model/arrayUnsupervisedLearning.htm) learning. But for
now, these web pages are painfully incomplete.

Finding outliers is an interesting approach that I had not devoted much
thought to. Perhaps the outliers are observations that merit additional
scrutiny. For example, in some applications, outliers may be potentially
fraudulent cases.

CRISP-DM is the model that SPSS uses to model data mining
([www.crisp-dm.org](http://www.crisp-dm.org)). The steps in CRISP-DM
include

-   Business understanding
-   Data understanding
-   Data preparation
-   Modeling
-   Evaluation
-   Deployment

There are several loop backs in this model. For example, data
understanding is involved in a feedback loop with business
understanding. Modeling is involved with a feedback loop with data
preparation. Evaluation, of course feeds back to business understanding.

Children's Memorial Hospital used Clementine and SPSS recognized by
Computerworld Honors Foundation for research for treatments of pediatric
brain tumors
([www.spss.com/press/template\_view.cfm?PR\_ID=636](http://www.spss.com/press/template_view.cfm?PR_ID=636)).

A nice feature of Clementine is that models generated by the software
can be exported as C code or XML which allows you to automate the
delivery of data mining solutions to other computer platforms or on the
web. It includes a module for mining data from text fields and a module
for extracting events from web logs.

The speaker mentioned a new model (CARMA \-- Continuous Association Rule
Mining Algorithm) which allows interactive pruning of rules in a
decision tree (<http://control.cs.berkeley.edu/carma.html>).

In a one hour presentation, you can't get a good feel for how the
software works. It looks like a good comprehensive package that is easy
to use. There are a lot of competing products out there, of course. One
of the more intriguing competitors is Weka, an open source system for
data mining. The [main site for
Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) is at the [University of
Waikato](http://www.waikato.ac.nz/) in Hamilton, New Zealand.

Since Weka is open source, it is popular with data mining classes at
universities where you can't ask the students to go out and buy a
thousand dollar software program (the price of college textbooks is
already bad enough).

A good book about Weka is **Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning
Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations**, by Ian H. Witten, Eibe
Frank (ISBN: 1558605525) [\[BookFinder4U

I have not had a chance to work with either Clementine or Weka.
