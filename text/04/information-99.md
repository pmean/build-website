The formula for uncertainty (sometimes referred to as entropy) is

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9901.gif)

By convention, if any probability is zero, we set the product term to
zero as well. Those of you who are familiar with calculus could use
limits to establish that zero is a reasonable value for this product.

**Data compression**

Consider this distribution of ratings:

The uncertainty calculation would be

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9903.gif)

Suppose we wanted to send a coded binary message that would indicate
what category the rater chose. A simple approach would use three
binary digits

-   A=000,
-   B=001,
-   C=010,
-   D=011,
-   E=100.

  to send the message. But you could use the probabilities involved to
save a bit of time. Set the most common category to a shorter binary
string, and longer strings to the less common categories

-   A=1,
-   B=000,
-   C=001,
-   D=010,
-   E=011.

Then half of the time we would only use one bit to send the message,
the other half of the time, we'd need three bits. On average, you
would use two bits, which is exactly the number produced by our
uncertainty calculation.

This example is a bit tricky because you might ask, why couldn't I
use two bits for B, C, D, and E. This would lead to a coding of

-   A=1,
-   B=00,
-   C=01,
-   D=10,
-   E=11.

The problem with this is that unless you could separate the bits, then
you couldn't distinguish between AA (11) and E (11). You'd need a
stop bit or some other type of separator, which would add to the
average length of a message.

Morse code also takes advantage of probabilities, with common letters
being shorter combinations of dots and dashes. The **single dot and
single dash are E and T**, while the **dot-dot, dot-dash, dash-dot,
and dash-dash are I, A, N, and M**, respectively. The letters that
require **four dots/dashes are B, C, F, H, J, L, P, Q, V, X, Y, and
Z**. Morse code, of course, was developed long before we understood
concepts like information theory, so it is not an optimal coding.
Still it represents an interesting example.

  -------- ----------- ---------- --------- ------- ---------- ---------- ----------- -------- ------------ --------- ---------- ---------
   **A**      **B**      **C**      **D**    **E**    **F**      **G**       **H**     **I**      **J**       **K**     **L**      **M**
   **.-**   **-...**   **-.-.**   **-..**   **.**   **..-.**   **--.**   **....**   **..**   **.---**   **-.-**   **.-..**   **--**
   **N**      **O**      **P**      **Q**    **R**    **S**      **T**       **U**     **V**      **W**       **X**     **Y**      **Z**
     -.       ---      .--.      --.-     .-.      ...        -         ..-      ...-       .--       -..-      -.--      --..
  -------- ----------- ---------- --------- ------- ---------- ---------- ----------- -------- ------------ --------- ---------- ---------

In general, there is not always a coding that gives the optimal number
of bits on average. The uncertainty represents the lower bound on
average compression rate.

**Huffman encoding**

One of the compression methods used by various Zip programs, [Huffman
encoding](http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/huffmanEncoding.html), takes
advantage of this feature. Instead of allocating 7/8 bits to each
character, it will remap the characters with the most frequently
occurring characters having short bit lengths and the least frequently
occurring characters having long bit lengths.

The following example appears on a rather amazing [page that animates
the Huffman encoding
algorithm](http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/~morris/Year2/PLDS210/huffman.html).
If you were to use a simple binary coding, it would require 5 bits for
each character of the alphabet A-Z. But Huffman Encoding uses a
variable number of bits to represent each letter. Notice that

-   **E and T use 3 bits,**
-   **A, I, L, N, O, R, and S use 4 bits,**
-   **B, C, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, W, and Y use 5-6 bits, and**
-   **J, K, Q, V, X and Z use 7-12 bits.**

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9904.gif)
![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9905.gif)
![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9906.gif)

The table shows that the surprisal values are close to the number of
digits used in Huffman encoding. The weighted average surprisal is
4.167, which tells us that it takes slightly more than 4 bits of
information to code this data. This is confirmed by the weighted
average number of bits, 4.196, which is just a tiny bit higher than
the uncertainty.

**Application to genetics**

This is a group of DNA segments representing Lambda cI and cro binding
sites.

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9907.gif)

Notice that there are some common patterns to these DNA segments but
also some uncertainty, especially at location zero. Information theory
helps define the degree to which these DNA segments have common
features.

First we need to compute the surprisal values.

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9908.gif)

If a letter has probability zero, that equals an infinite surprisal
value and is dentoed by Inf in the table. Notice that letters A and G
have high surprisal values in the -9 position because they only appear
rarely.

The weighted surprisals appear below.

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9909.gif)

The uncertainty for this group of DNA segments is 17.5. The maximum
possible uncertainty is 38 (2 bits times 19 base pairs). The
information is 10.5 which represents the maximum possible uncertainty
minus the uncertainty observed in this group.

One way of thinking of this is that if you knew nothing about the 19
base pair DNA segment, you would have a large amount of uncertainty
(38 bits). If instead you restricted the DNA segments to the 12 listed
above, you would have a lot less uncertainty. The information
contained in these DNA segments represents the decrease in
uncertainty.

You can also compute the information at any given base pair. The
information is highest at -7, -5, and +5, because these are the base
pairs where there is no variation. Information is also high at -3, +3,
because the probabilities of C and G respectively are almost 100%.

The following graph illustrates the information at each base pair with
the heights of each letter indicating how much that particular letter
contributes to the information.

**Evaluating new DNA segments**

There's another way to calculate uncertainty for these DNA segments,
and although it is a bit more work, it provides a clue for how to
evaluate new DNA segments. Notice that for each base pair location, we
have surprisal values for A, C, G, and T. We can evaluate those
surprisal values for each DNA segment.

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9911.gif)

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9912.gif)

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9913.gif)

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9914.gif)

Now we can average these values across all 12 DNA segments. This gives
us the same weighted surprisals and the same uncertainty as before.

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9915.gif)

This could help us understand whether one or more of the DNA segments
does not fit in with the others, but more importantly, it can help us
identify new DNA segments that might fit into the same class of
binding sites. If a DNA segment has a reasonably low total surprisal,
then that indicates that this DNA segment might fit in, but if the
surprisal is too high, then this DNA segment is too different to be in
this class of binding sites.

**Information theory applied to sperm morphology classifications**

One of the more fascinating applications of information theory is in
the study of sperm morphology, the classification of sperm cells into
various size and shape categories.

Human sperm exist in many different shapes and sizes. There are many
irregular and abnormal forms. Forms display continuous variation and
there are lots of gradual transitions from one form to another. As a
result, sperm morphology has greater inter- and intra-laboratory
variation than many other tests.

Although sperm morphology is a tool used in fertility assessment,
fertility is a complex process that involves multiple organs of both
the male and the female. Given this complexity, it would be a mistake
to think that a sperm analysis is going to be a valid maker of
fertility. Instead, semen analysis is a "gateway" test for
fertility. It determines the path of further testing and which partner
should receive greater scrutiny.

There are many sperm morphology classification schemes, and much
controversy over what to use.

A good friend of mine, Susan Rothmann has an NIH grant to review
morphology classification as it is currently practiced. The long term
goal of the grant is to get greater consistency within and between
laboratories. The preliminary data from this grant involved the
classification of 160 sperm images by 99 trained raters.

Raters were asked to evaluate

-     the sperm head,
-   the acrosome region of the head,
-   the postacrosomal regions of the head,
-   the sperm midpiece, and
-   the sperm tail.

The following picture describes the various parts of the sperm cell:

![](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/04/information-9916.gif)

In addition, the raters were asked to classify non-sperm cells such as
monocytes and macrophages that appeared in the sample. Here is a list
of the classifications available in the Rothmann study:

-   Head not oval (HdNOv)
-   Head round (HdRnd)
-   Head tapering (HdTap)
-   Head pyriform (HdPyr)
-   Multiple heads (HdMul)
-   Amorphous head (HdAmr)
-   Small head (HdSml)
-   Large head (HdLrg)
-   Abnormal Head Ratio (HdRat)
-   Acrosome large (AcLrg)
-   Acrosome small (AcSml)
-   Acrosome deformed (AcDef)
-   Acrosome missing (AcMis)
-   Postacrosomal abnormal size (PoSiz)
-   Postacrosomal abnormal shape (PoShp)
-   Vacuoles (Vacuo)
-   Midpiece thick (MdThk)
-   Midpiece very thick (MdVTh)
-   Midpiece irregular (MdIrr)
-   Midpiece length (MdLen)
-   Midpiece bent (MdBnt)
-   Midpiece missing (MdMis)
-   Midpiece droplet (MdCyt)
-     Midpiece incorrect insertion(MdIns)
-   Tail coiled (TCoil)
-   Tail short (TShrt)
-   Tail broken (TBrok)
-   Multiple tails (TMult)
-   Hairpin tail (THpin)
-   Tail width (TWdth)
-   Tail droplet (TDrop)
-   Tail bent (TBent)
-   Leukocyte (Leuko)
-   Polymononuclear leukocyte (P.M.N)
-   Monocyte (Moncy)
-   Macrophage (Mcrph)
-   Immature sperm cell (Immat)
-   Spermatid (Sptid)
-   Spermatocyte (Spcyt)

Not every person will use every one of these abnormal categories. The
list was intended to be the collection of classifications across all
systems. In addition to the specific rating categories shown above,
each rater was asked to provide an overall classification:

-     Definitely normal,
-   Possibly abnormal,
-   Definitely abnormal, and
-   Non-sperm cell.

Here are two examples of the micrographs of sperm cells that the
raters were asked to evaluate.

This picture and the one below it are not as good quality as the ones
that the raters used, but I just wanted you to see the general type of
images they were asked to rate.

**What information theory can tell us about sperm classification**

Certain sperm images are easier to classify and others are more
difficult to classify. The former represent exemplars that can be
displayed as model images of a particular classification. The latter
represent areas of controversy and disagreement that need to be
examined, perhaps by a consensus group, to resolve the ambiguity.
Identifying the easy and difficult images is difficult by visual
inspection, because of the large number of images and the variety of
classifications available. We plan to use uncertainty to sift through
those images and rapidly identify images both easy and difficult for
further study.

**Uncertainty for overall classification**

The table below shows the overall classification and the uncertainty
calculated on that classification.

  ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
  Cell   Norm   Bord   Abno   NonS   NotC   Unce
  1      24     34     41     0      0      1.6
  7      62     18     19     0      0      1.3
  2      79     12     7      1      0      1.0
  5      13     8      78     0      0      0.9
  3      4      10     85     0      0      0.7
  4      0      5      94     0      0      0.3
  6      1      2      96     0      0      0.2
  ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------

The first column identifies the particular cell, and the possible
classifications are abbreviated as

-   Norm (Definitely normal)
-   Bord (Borderline abnormal)
-   Abno (Definitely abnormal)
-   NonS (Non-Sperm Cell)
-   NotC (Not Classified)

and "Entr" represents the calculated uncertainty. The cell with the
greatest uncertainty (among the first seven cells) is cell #1. You
can see by the rater counts that there was very little agreement about
the overall classification of this cell.

The two cells with the least uncertainty are cells 4 and 6, and these
are cells that pretty much everyone agrees are abnormal.

**Information theory for individual classification**

It is also possible to calculate uncertainty for each individual
classification and then add these uncertainty values together. Cells
with high total uncertainty represent cells with uncertainty across
several classification categories. Here are the results for the first
seven sperm cells with the percentages shown for any category selected
by 5% or more of the raters:

Sperm #6. Uncertainty = 8.1

-   TCoil: 53%
-   TShrt: 44%
-   MdThk: 31%
-   MdVTh: 23%
-   THpin: 17%
-   MdLen: 13%
-   MdIrr: 11%
-   TWdth: 10%
-   HdNOv: 8%
-   HdPyr: 6%

Sperm #5. Uncertainty = 7.6

-   Vacuo: 57%
-   HdNOv: 32%
-   HdRnd: 25%
-   THpin: 20%
-   AcSml: 12%
-   HdSml: 11%
-   HdRat: 10%
-   TCoil: 9%

Sperm #3. Uncertainty = 6.4

-   MdCyt: 64%
-   HdNOv: 17%
-   MdIrr: 16%
-   HdTap: 14%
-   MdVTh: 10%
-   AcSml: 10%
-   HdRat: 9%
-   HdSml: 9%
-   MdThk: 7%
-   HdPyr: 5%

Sperm #1. Uncertainty = 5.8

-   HdNOv: 33%
-   HdPyr: 29%
-   PoShp: 14%
-   MdIns: 9%
-   MdThk: 9%
-   HdLrg: 9%
-   HdRat: 8%
-   HdRnd: 7%
-   HdTap: 6%

Sperm #4. Uncertainty = 5.2

-     MdVTh: 58%
-     MdCyt: 52%
-     HdNOv: 12%
-     MdIrr: 9%
-     HdLrg: 7%
-     HdRat: 6%

Sperm #7. Uncertainty = 2.4

-     TBrok: 10%
-     TShrt: 9%
-     HdNOv: 7%

Sperm #2. Uncertainty = 1.7

-   HdNOv: 8%

Notice that cell #6, the cell with the lowest uncertainty on the
overall classification, has the highest uncertainty among the seven
cells when looking at the individual classification levels. This
reflects the fact that raters agree that the cell is abnormal, but
they can't agree on the type of abnormality.

**Future work--joint and conditional uncertainty**

To calculate the total uncertainty in the sperm classification system
above, I oversimplified a bit by adding the individual entropies for
each individual classification system. This ignores some possibly
important information. Let's suppose that we have a two
classifications: Small head (HdSml) and Missing Acrosome (AcMis).
Let's suppose there is a high amount of uncertainty in both
categories:

  ------- ----- -----
         Yes   No
                 

  HdSml   50%   50%
  ------- ----- -----

and

  ------- ----- -----
         Yes   No
                 

  AcMis   50%   50%
  ------- ----- -----

There would be one full bit of uncertainty with each classification.
But how do these classifications behave jointly? Here are two
possibilities:

  ----- ----- -----
       Yes   No
               

  Yes   0%    50%

  No    50%   0%
  ----- ----- -----

and

  ----- ----- -----
       Yes   No
               

  Yes   25%   25%

  No    25%   25%
  ----- ----- -----

The first situation reflects a case where everyone agrees the cell is
abnormal but half of the raters call it a small head and half of the
raters call it a missing acrosome. The only uncertainty is in the use
of labels.

The second situation is much more uncertain. A quarter of the raters
say the cell has no defects, a quarter say is has two defects, and the
remaining raters are split between calling the cell a small head only
or a missing acrosome only.

You could calculate joint uncertainty by just treating the 2 by 2
table as a 4 by1 set of probabilities:

  --------- -------- -------- -------
  Yes/Yes   Yes/No   No/Yes   No/No
  0%        50%      50%      0%
  --------- -------- -------- -------

and

  --------- -------- -------- -------
  Yes/Yes   Yes/No   No/Yes   No/No
  25%       25%      25%      25%
  --------- -------- -------- -------

This would then allow you to calculate the joint uncertainty, and it
would be 1 bit and 2 bits, respectively. The second situation, has
much greater uncertainty, even though the marginal probabilities are
identical to the first situation.

You can also define uncertainty using conditional probabilities, and
the quantity produced, conditional uncertainty, represents how much
the uncertainty in one variable is reduced when another variable is
known.

There are several sperm morphology classification systems in use. Two
commonly used systems are WHO-3 classification and strict
classification. Strict classification works like it sounds, with
borderline defects being classified as abnormal. In contrast, WHO-3
tends to classify borderline defects as normal.

Each of the 160 raters identified the system that they use. One area I
want to look at is how the uncertainty decreases when you condition on
rating system.
