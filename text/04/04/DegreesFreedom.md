**[StATS]: Degrees of freedom, Part 2 (April 15,
2004)**.

I received an email inquiry about degrees of freedom. I [explain the
concept briefly](../ask/df.asp), but this person wanted a more detailed
answer to the question, why do we use n-1 in the calculation of the
standard deviation and not n?

You can argue that the standard deviation involves the projection onto a
subspace of dimension n-1, because the n deviations from the mean have a
single constraint\--they must sum to zero. That may not be a very
satisfying answer.

Another answer is that using n-1 provides a good statistical property,
unbiasedness, but that applies to the variance and not to the standard
deviation.

Some statisticians (not many) have argued that you should not use n-1,
but should use n instead. They make a persuasive argument, but since
almost everyone uses n-1, why swim against the tide? There are more
important battles to fight, such as the mindless acceptance of an alpha
level of .05 for every hypothesis test ever done.
