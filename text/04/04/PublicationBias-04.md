**[StATS]: A serious problem of publication bias
(April 9, 2004)**.

I was browsing a paper by Leonard Leibovici
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=10600974)
about alternative medicine when a [comment by Andrew
Vickers](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/319/7225/1629#6000)  in
the eletters section caught my eye. He noted the serious problem of
publication bias in Chinese journals. Apparently, the Chinese journals
almost never publish a negative trial. He cites two sources: Vickers et
al 1998 CCT
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9551280&dopt=Abstract)
and Tang et al 1999 BMJ
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10406751&dopt=Abstract).

I only have the abstract of the Vickers paper, but the numbers quoted
there are astounding. In studies of accupuncture, every single trial
published in China was positive. In areas other than acupuncture, 99% of
the trials were positive.

The full text of the Tang article is on the web, and it has some
surprising results as well. They show a funnel plot, which I\'ve never
liked much because they are so hard to interpret. But you have to take
the time to look at [this particular funnel
plot](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/319/7203/160/Fu1),
because it is as striking an example of publication bias as you will
ever see. It shows the effect size of 49 studies of acupuncture on the
horizontal axis and the size of the studies on the vertical axis. If 
there is no publication bias, the studies should arrange themselves in a
funnel shape with tight variation at the top where the large studies are
and spreading out gradually as you move down the graph to represent the
fact that smaller studies tend to have more variation. The funnel plot
shown in the Tang article shows, with the exception of a two or three of
studies, that the left side of the funnel has been sliced cleanly away.
It\'s hard to come up with any conclusion other than publication bias.
