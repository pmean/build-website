> I use Microsoft FrontPage, and their newsletter listed a [resources
> for creating printer friendly web
> pages](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HA011438981033.aspx).
> I dislike the idea of having a separate set of pages for printing, and
> try instead to find a good balance so that the page looks good both on
> the screen and on paper. This is not always easy, but writing for the
> web has always been filled with difficult compromises. Page breaks are
> impossible to control, and often I get an orphan line at the top or
> bottom of the page.
>
> The basic things I do are:
>
> > **1. Avoid a lot of navigation links on the left hand side of the
> > screen.** I feel like I'm swimming against the tide here, but I
> > have never liked cluttering up the screen or the page with a bunch
> > of navigation links. I especially dislike the almost universal
> > tendency to put those links on the left hand side of the page. It
> > doesn't look good and it interferes with the ability to print
> > well. In my mind, navigation links belong at the top of the page
> > (with possibly a repetition at the bottom of the page).
> >
> > **2. No frames.** Here I have a bit more support from my colleagues.
> > Frames exist more for the convenience of the web author than for the
> > web reader. I also have not used tables to control the line width.
> > You want a narrow line width when reading on the screen, but this
> > leads to a lot of wasted paper when you print. Instead of tables, I
> > use the \<blockquote\> tag to provide reasonable margins. If the
> > wide lines of my web pages make it hard to read, consider making
> > your browser window a bit narrower.
> >
> > **3. Moderate sizes for graphic images.** It is very hard, but I try
> > to keep all my graphic images around 400 pixels or so. When I am
> > showing screen dumps of dialog boxes in SPSS, this is not always
> > possible. I saw a web page a while back that did the math and showed
> > that images more than 525 pixels (don't quote me on that number)
> > would not be guaranteed to print well. I also avoid more than 300
> > pixels in height because that will often cause an awkward page
> > breaks. Sometimes I break a graphic image into several pieces so
> > that a more natural page break can occur.
> >
> > **4. No background and limited use of color.** Backgrounds set a
> > mood for a web page, and I have always felt that the quality of the
> > writing was the only important thing. But backgrounds also interfere
> > with your ability to print well. The same is true for colors. When I
> > first started, it was fun to use a soft yellow background, but I
> > gradually came to realize that it added nothing to my pages, and
> > made printing a bit trickier as well. The more recent browsers seem
> > to know when to ignore backgrounds and when to switch colors, but
> > why take the chance that some mood setting combination makes it
> > difficult to print your web pages?
>
> I'm part of a larger web site
> ([www.childrensmercy.org](http://www.childrensmercy.org)) and I have
> to maintain some level of consistency with their pages. That leads to
> a navigation bar at the top that does not fit in well with the rest of
> my site and which does not print well either. I'll try to work with
> the webmaster to reconcile these problems when I have time.
>
> The two web sites that have most influenced how I design my own pages
> are:
>
> -   [www.contentious.com/](http://www.contentious.com/) and
> -   [www.useit.com/](http://www.useit.com/)
>
> There was a very good article about web design that argued for a
> minimalist approach and drew an analogy to Shaker furniture. This
> appeared in the Winter 1997 newsletter of the American Statistical
> Association sections on Statistical Computing and Statistical Graphics
> ([pdf
> format](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~susan/scgn/issues/v82/v82.pdf)).
> This is a big file, and the article itself doesn't start until page
> 23, but it is well worth looking at. Here's one of my favorite quotes
> from that article.
>
> > *A Shaker chair is useful. It is well suited for sitting. Its clean,
> > smooth lines have no excess adornment; the beauty of the wood is
> > adornment enough. So should Web sites be structured for maximum
> > utility, allowing the value of their content to attract and hold
> > user interest.*
