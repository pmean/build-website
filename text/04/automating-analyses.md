> Many of my projects involve writing a program in my text editor

> [Stata](http://www.stata.com/). I just found out through the [Stata
> Text Editor FAQ](http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/t/textEditors.html)
> about a new product, [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/),
> that can simplify this process. In the past, I had used a commercial
> product, [QuicKeys](http://www.quickeys.com/), to automate some of my
> work, but have not used it recently. AutoIt is an [Open
> Source](http://www.opensource.org/) program which means that the
> source code is open for others to modify or improve it.

> In another [weblog entry](acuity.html), I have discussed the [GNU

> distinction](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html),
> but both GNU and Open Source, but from a practical perspective both
> provide good alternatives to proprietary software.

> I'll investigate AutoIt when I have time and report back on the
> results.
