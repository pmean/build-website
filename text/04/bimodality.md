**[StATS]: Searching for bimodality (August 4,
2004)**

One of the people I work with is always looking for hidden subgroups
in his data. For him, this is a starting point for exploring for
genetic variations.

That's an admirable activity, but it is remarkably difficult to thing
to do in practice. The first step is to see if the distribution of
values for some measurement has a bimodal distribution. A second mode
is an indication of a subgroup of patients that may have a genetic
variation from the rest of the patients.

A histogram, like the one shown above is a quick and simple way to
look for bimodality. The problem is that histograms are very sensitive
to how thick

or thin

the bars are. Indications for bimodality may appear or disappear
depending on how you draw the histogram.

A QQplot is much better because it is not dependent on bar widths.

![bi07.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/images/images/04/bimodality04.png)

The QQplot compares your data to evenly spaced percentiles from a
normal distribution. If you had nine data values, the smallest one
would be compared to the 10th percentile, the next smallest one to the
20th percentile and so forth, until the largest one was compared to
the 90th percentile of a normal distribution.

A straight line on the QQplot indicates data that is well approximated
by a normal distribution. If instead you see two distinct lines, then
this is a possible indication of bimodality.

Interpretation of the QQplot is somewhat subjective, and we all have a
tendency to overinterpret small deviations. One way to quantify this
calculation is to compute a correlation between the data and normal
percentiles. This will always be large, but if it is very close to +1,
that indicates normality. A slightly smaller value indicates
non-normality of one form or another. It might actually be something
like skewness instead of bimodality, so further investigation would be
needed.

The correlation does not have to be that much smaller than 1 to
indicate non-normality. A value of 0.90 or even 0.95 might be
sufficient evidence. There are tables for this, but you can quickly
compute a critical value yourself.

In the example shown above, there are 46 observations. The correlation
between the data and the normal scores is 0.969.

So let's compute 46 observations that really do come from a single
normal distribution and see how they behave. Here's some S-plus/R
code to do this calculation

`x <- rnorm(46)        z <- qnorm(rank(x)/47)        cor(x,z)                [1] 0.9803026`

Notice that   the batch of perfectly normal data did indeed have a
correlation closer to one. Let's repeat this a thousand times and see
what happens.

`co <- rep(NA,1000)        for (i in 1:1000) {    x <- rnorm(46)    z <- qnorm(rank(x)/47)    co[i] <- cor(x,z)        }        mean(co)                [1] 0.9879957`

So the average correlation when the data is perfectly normal is much
higher than the value we observed.

`quantile(co,probs=0.05)                      5%        0.9738147`

Even the fifth percentile of these correlations is still larger than
0.969. So we would conclude that there is some evidence of
non-normality and would then investigate further to see if it was
indeed bimodality.

The formal statistical tests for bimodality are quite complex, but I
will try to illustrate them when I get a chance.
