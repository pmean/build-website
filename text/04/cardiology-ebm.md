There was a nice series of articles in the journal Circulation that
appeared in 2002 with free full text online. These articles offer
specific lessons about evidence-based medicine.

In the [August 6
issue](http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/106/6/746), DeMets
and Califf tackle the difficult topics of

-   surrogate outcome measures,
-   composite clinical endpoints,
-   and subgroup analysis.

In the [August 13
issue](http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/106/7/880), DeMets
and Califf continue with a discussion about

-   independent data monitoring committees,
-   blinding,
-   publication bias,
-   non-inferiority trials,
-   the FDA requirement for two confirmatory trials,
-   and the use of primary and secondary endpoints.

In the [August 20
issue](http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/106/8/1015), Califf
and DeMets show that most therapies

-   have modest effects,
-   have quantitative but not qualitative interactions,
-   influences (for better or for worse) on unintended biological
    pathways,
-   behave unexpectedly when combined with other therapies,
-   have long term effects that are different from short term effects,
    and
-   are not easily lumped into classes of drugs.

In the [August 27
issue](http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/106/9/1172), Califf
and DeMets continue with observations that most therapies

-   have a mix of helpful and harmful effects, and
-   cannot be justified on purely economic benefits.

They also conclude that randomized clinical trials

-   are necessary for the development of clinical guidelines,
-   ignore may underserved areas, and that doctors
-   and need greater participation from doctors and patients.

Many of the topics discussed in this series of papers relate to my web
page, [Mountain or Molehill](../journal/mountain.asp), which talks about
the clinical importance of research findings. When I get a chance, I
want to update that page to incorporate many of the examples discussed
in this excellent series.

Other recent articles have valuable lessons as well.

In the past, women have been unfairly excluded from clinical trials. In
a 2000 NEJM review article by Harris et al
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10944565&dopt=Abstract),
the authors show that some recent gain have occurred but more progress
is still needed. A 2001 JAMA review article by Lee et al
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11495621&dopt=Abstract),
reaches the same conclusions and also points out that elderly patients
are still being underrepresented in clinical trials. For example,
patients over the age of 75 are responsible for 37% of all myocardial
infarctions, but in the 1990s they were included as only 9% of all
patients in trials studying this condition. This is an improvement over
the participation rate from earlier times, but still short of what it
should be.

Griffith et al discuss left ventricular hypertrophy as a surrogate
marker. Kelloff et al also discuss surrogate endpoints. In an AIM 2003
paper, Messerli discusses secondary endpoints, a topic also covered by
Moye in 2001.
