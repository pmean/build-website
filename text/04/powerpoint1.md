> This is the text of a talk I gave to Bluejacket Toastmasters on July
> 15, 2004.

**Introduction**

> The May Issue of Toastmasters Magazine had several articles about
> electronic presentations, which in 95% of the cases means PowerPoint
> presentations. One author (Eric Spellmann) summarizes the viewpoint
> that I've come to despise. He writes:
>
> > *PowerPoint also can liven up an otherwise boring topic. In addition
> > to using vibrant text and background colors, presenters can choose
> > from a wide variety of clip art and photos. And when using
> > PowerPoint's animation and sound options, these graphics can shake,
> > rattle and roll.*

**The \<BLINK\> tag**

> All of this reminds me of the early years of the World Wide Web. There
> were some truly atrocious looking web sites out there that relied on a
> bunch of cheap electronic gimmicks. And the **worst gimmick of all was
> the BLINK tag**.
>
> When you are writing a page for the web, you surround text with tags
> that will tell the text how to display itself. Text surrounded by the
> **BOLD tags** will display itself in bold and text surrounded by the
> **ITALIC tags** will display itself in italics.
>
> If you surround some text with the BLINK tag, it will flash on and off
> and on and off and on and off **forever**. The BLINK tag would
> invariably draw the eye to the blinking text, so some web pages would
> use it for phrases like **BUY NOW \... BUY NOW \... BUY NOW \... BUY
> NOW**.
>
> Blinking text is **interesting for about two seconds**, but after that
> it become **annoying**. People quickly came to recognize that web
> sites using the BLINK tag were **cheap and amateurish**.
>
> Design experts actually did some scientific studies about the BLINK
> tag on web pages. What they found was that when people encountered a
> page with blinking text, they did one of two things. If they could,
> they immediately clicked on the **BACK button** to close the page. If
> they couldn't do this, they would **cover up the blinking text with
> one hand** and tried to read the rest of the text.

**Why Powerpoint doesn't help**

> The problem with PowerPoint is that it is a **box full of BLINK
> tags**\--cheap amateurish gimmicks.
>
> Can Powerpoint **salvage** a boring talk? Not really.
>
> If your topic is boring, then it won't become less boring by changing
> your text to a **firecracker red**, or adding **soft clouds** in the
> background, or placing a clip art image of a **racer crossing the
> finish lin**e, or having the new slides **spin into place**, or
> playing a **cute melody** at each slide transition.

**What is the cure for a boring topic?**

> The best cure for a boring topic is to **not talk about things that
> are boring**. Part of this is believing in yourself and your topic. If
> you see your topic as boring, then the battle is lost before you have
> spoken your first word. Search for the aspect of your topic that will
> **captivate and enthrall** your audience, that will **mesmerize and
> intrigue** them.
>
> Adding some PowerPoint gimmicks to a talk is no better than tossing a
> bunch of **unrelated jokes** into your talk.

**PowerPoint will run a good talk into the ground**

> PowerPoint is **worse than useless**, though. PowerPoint can take a
> good talk and run it into the ground..
>
> Peter Norvig, one of the computer geeks behind the Google search
> engine, imagined how awful it would be **if Abraham Lincoln had to use
> PowerPoint for the Gettysburg address**. Visualize a tall thin man
> with a short beard and a stove pipe hat. He's staring down at a
> **laptop computer**.
>
> > *Do I press this button here? Function-F7? No, that's not right.
> > Hmmm. Maybe I'll have to reboot. Hold on a minute.*
>
> Peter Norvig fed the full text of Lincoln's Gettysburg address into
> something called the **PowerPoint AutoContent Wizard**. What the
> AutoContent Wizard does, and you should be **very frightened** that
> computers do this, is that it digests the talks, throws out the
> unimportant words and **spits out bullets** on a series of Powerpoint
> slides. So, for example, the AutoContent Wizard took the phrase
>
> > *dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal*
>
> and created a bullet
>
> -   *Men are equal*
>
> Can't you just feel PowerPoint **sucking out all the passion** from
> Lincoln's speech. In contrast, look at the full text of Lincoln's
> speech on your handout. The writing is just brilliant. The second
> sentence reads
>
> > *Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that
> > nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.*
>
> Any effort to put these words onto a PowerPoint slide would just
> **cheapen** those words.

**What if you have to use PowerPoint?**

> I believe that PowerPoint never adds to the quality of a talk and will
> often detract from the quality. But what if **your boss** says that
> you have to use PowerPoint?
>
> Do you have the option of telling your boss that **he's an idiot**?
>
> No, I didn't think so.
>
> If you have to use PowerPoint, use it to the **minimum extent
> possible**.
>
> 1.  Avoid clip art, animation, and any special effects.
> 2.  Write full sentences with both a subject and a verb.
> 3.  Use black letters on a white background.
>
> This last point is very important. Black letters on a white background
> is by far the easiest combination to read and it works well under
> harsh environments, which is far easier to read than any other
> combination. Other color combinations may create a variety of
> different moods, but setting a mood is less important than making your
> slides readable.
>
> Finally, use as few slides as you can and spend most of your time
> talking to your audience. The **ideal** PowerPoint presentation would
> be a **single slide** that lists the general outline of your talk.
>
> Ten years ago, I used PowerPoint (or its precursor, the overhead
> transparency) for all my talks. Today I **print off a web page** and
> hand it out to the audience at the start of my talk. I have found this
> to be **liberating**, because I no longer **fumble at the computer**
> or the overhead projector. I no longer **look back over my shoulder**
> to make sure that the slide is displayed properly. I **look at my
> audience** instead, which is what you're supposed to do.

**Summary**

> In summary, PowerPoint **won't improve a bad talk**, and they may
> **detract from a good talk**. Trying to improve a talk with PowerPoint
> is like trying to improve your **weight loss program** in the **candy
> aisle** of the supermarket.
