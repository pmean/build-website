The Journal of Medical Ethics has a [series of articles about ethics and
evidence based
medicine](http://jme.bmjjournals.com/misc/advanced.shtml). These are
pre-prints of articles under review and you can prepare a response to
these articles. I found the article ["Ethical problems arising in
evidencebased complementary and alternative medicine" Edzard Ernst,
Michael H. Cohen, Julie Stone
\[pdf\]](http://jme.bmjjournals.com/cgi/data/26/1/DC1/9) to be
especially intriguing. I hope to write a web page sometime about whether
the standards of evidence based medicine should be modified for
alternative therapies. There is a lot of discussion about how randomized
trials are "reductionist" and while some of this is post-modernist
nonsense, there are still some points worth considering. On the other
side of the equation, since alternative medicine claims often violate
many of the criteria for [causality](../ask/causation.asp), perhaps
their claims should be held to an even higher standard ([extraordinary
claims require extraordinary
proof](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/extraproof.html)).

Another pre-print, ["Ethics and Evidence-based Surgery" Gordon M.
Stirrat \[pdf\]](http://jme.bmjjournals.com/cgi/data/26/1/DC1/10), to be
interesting. Surgery is an area where good evidence is hard to get,
partly because blinding and the use of placebo operations are often
problematic. I also liked this article, because the author cited one of
my works, "Is the randomized clinical trial the gold standard of
research?"
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11700857&dopt=Abstract).

It's not clear if the full text of these papers will remain available
after they have been officially published.
