> With over a thousand web pages, I need a good way of letting people
> find related topics on my website. I've added categories to my weblog
> entries, and now I want to link those categories to the appropriate
> location on my topiclist page. That way, if you are on a page
> discussing early stopping of clinical trials, you can jump to another
> page that lists all of the other pages on my website with the same
> topic. It will take a while to make all these changes. For now, here
> is a list of the categories that I have placed live links in all of
> the weblog entries:
>
> -   [Category: Clinical
>     importance](../category/ClinicalImportance.html)
> -   [Category: Confidence
>     intervals](../category/ConfidenceIntervals.html)
> -   [Category: Early stopping in clinical
>     trials](../category/EarlyStopping.html)
> -   [Category: Post hoc power](../category/PostHocPower.html)
> -   [Category: Privacy concerns](../category/PrivacyInResearch.html)
> -   [Category: R software](../category/RSoftware.html)
> -   [Category: Sample size
>     justification](../category/SampleSizeJustification.html)
> -   [Category: Small sample size
>     issues](../category/SmallSampleSizeIssues.html)
> -   [Category: SPSS software](../category/SpssSoftware.html)
