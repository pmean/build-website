> **A visit from a thief.**
>
> Student Leaf asked Master Stem, "*I have heard some of my teachers
> say 'I accept the null hypothesis' and others say 'I fail to reject
> the alternative hypothesis.' Why do these words not mean the same
> thing?*"
>
> Master Stem scoffed "*Bah, these teachers of yours! They do not
> understand probability, every single one of them.*"
>
> Student Leaf asked "*But what does probability have to do with it?
> The null hypothesis is true or it is not. Where is the probability?*"
>
> Master Stem replied "*All hypotheses have probability if you consider
> them carefully. Consider a thief who visits your house. You do not see
> anything unusual during the visit, but after the thief leaves, you
> find that your jewelry has been stolen.*"
>
> Student Stem replies "*Then the thief must have taken the jewels.*"
>
> "*Are you so sure? The night that the thief visited, was the night
> that you had a great celebration, and one hundred people came and
> visited. Only after everyone had left did you notice that the jewels
> were gone.*"
>
> "*Then the thief probably did not take the jewels, Master Stem. It
> was probably one of the other guests.*"
>
> "*But you had the police investigate. They searched the houses of all
> the other guests and these searches did not yield the jewels.*"
>
> "*Then the other guests are innocent. It must have been the thief
> because only his house could have contained the jewels.*"
>
> "*That is reasonable, perhaps, if you believe that there is no other
> hiding place for the jewels. But I forgot to mention that the police
> are very busy and they did not search very carefully in any one
> house.*"
>
> "*Then I am not sure what to believe, Master Stem.*"
>
> "*You never believe anything with certainty, Student Leaf. A thief
> visits your house. You have an initial level of mistrust because I
> have called this person a thief. Think about what this means. This
> person has been known to steal from others, so you have a high degree
> of belief that he may have stolen from you as well. Now I provide you
> with more information. Each piece of information either increases or
> decreases your degree of belief. But no matter how much data you
> accumulate, you will never have certainty, just a degree of belief.*"
>
> "*How then, Master Stem, am I able to make any decision, if I never
> have certainty.*"
>
> "*There is balance, Student Leaf. How much do you lose if the thief
> is allowed to get away with the crime? What is the consequence of the
> loss of face when your accusations of thievery are proven false?*"
>
> "*I do not know if I can assign a value to these things, Master
> Stem.*"
>
> "*Such foolishness. You want to make very important decisions about
> these jewels, but not once did you think to assess their value. Were
> they but a trifle? Then be very careful not to risk your reputation
> over such a small thing. Were the jewels of great beauty and
> incomparable value? Then do not let any small thing stand in the way
> of possibly recovering such a great treasure.*"
