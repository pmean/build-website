This page is obsolete. I am keeping it around for nostalgic reasons. Some of the links on this page are broken and I will try to fix them when I have time.

I've been busy adding new pages and improving old pages. Here's a
summary of my activity.


 **New pages**. I have added two new courses to my training page:

-   [Stats \#53: Signal Detection Strategies for Paediatric Treatments][sim3], and
-   [Stats \#71: Control charts for continuous monitoring of the number needed to harm][sim4].

These courses are incomplete, but I hope to finish them quickly, as I
will be talking about both topics in London at the PharmaIQ conference

I've also added some definitions to my definitions page:

-   [Stats: What is a control chart?][sim5]
-   [Stats: What is a special cause of variation?][sim6]
-   [Stats: What is a common cause of variation?][sim7]

I've also added some more items about my book. I started an "Answer" page for the "On Your Own" exercises that appear at the end of each chapter.

-   [Statistical Evidence: Answers to "Own Your Own" exercises.][sim8]

This page is just getting started and I only have answers to two of the exercises, but I want to work on this quicly, as well, because I mention the web page in the second printing of my book. I also created a short summary page about my book,

-   [Stats: Information about my book, Statistical Evidence in Medical Trials][sim9]

and I want to include that brief summary at the beginning of my training classes and seminars.

**Improvements**. The [topic list for my weblog][sima] has been an useful way to organize the wide ranging set of topics covered in my weblog. I am working on updating the topic list and cross-referencing material from other pages that pre-dated the weblog. For example, when you go to [Category: Sample size justification][simb], you will see a list of appropriate weblog entries, and also links to some of the entries on my [Selecting an appropriate sample size][simc] page. Eventually, I want every page on my site to link to one (or maybe two) categories on my topic list page.

As a second improvement, I decided it would be more friendly and useful if I titled each definition in the form of a question ("What is an alpha level?" as opposed to just "Alpha level" for example) and I want to start linking these entries to the appropriate categories in the topic list.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [old website][sim2].
