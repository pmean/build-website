**[StATS]:** **Additions and improvements to my web
pages (November 2, 2006)**. [Category: Website
details](../category/WebsiteDetails.html)

> I\'ve been busy adding new pages and improving old pages. Here\'s a
> summary of my activity.
>
> **New pages**. I have added two new courses to my training page:
>
> -   [Stats \#53: Signal Detection Strategies for Paediatric
>     Treatments](../training/hand53.asp), and
> -   [Stats \#71: Control charts for continuous monitoring of the
>     number needed to harm](../training/hand71.asp).
>
> These courses are incomplete, but I hope to finish them quickly, as I
> will be talking about both topics in London at the PharmaIQ conference
>
> I\'ve also added some definitions to my definitions page:
>
> -   [Stats: What is a control
>     chart?](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/ControlChart.htm)
> -   [Stats: What is a special cause of
>     variation?](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/SpecialCause.htm)
> -   [Stats: What is a common cause of
>     variation?](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/CommonCause.htm)
>
> I\'ve also added some more items about my book. I started an
> \"Answer\" page for the \"On Your Own\" exercises that appear at the
> end of each chapter.
>
> -   [Statistical Evidence: Answers to \"Own Your Own\"
>     exercises.](../evidence/answers.asp)
>
> This page is just getting started and I only have answers to two of
> the exercises, but I want to work on this quicly, as well, because I
> mention the web page in the second printing of my book. I also created
> a short summary page about my book,
>
> -   [Stats: Information about my book, Statistical Evidence in Medical
>     Trials](../training/extras/book.htm)
>
> and I want to include that brief summary at the beginning of my
> training classes and seminars.
>
> **Improvements**. The [topic list for my weblog](../TopicList.html)
> has been an useful way to organize the wide ranging set of topics
> covered in my weblog. I am working on updating the topic list and
> cross-referencing material from other pages that pre-dated the weblog.
> For example, when you go to [Category: Sample size
> justification](../category/SampleSizeJustification.html), you will see
> a list of appropriate weblog entries, and also links to some of the
> entries on my [Selecting an appropriate sample size](../size.asp)
> page. Eventually, I want every page on my site to link to one (or
> maybe two) categories on my topic list page.
>
> As a second improvement, I decided it would be more friendly and
> useful if I titled each definition in the form of a question (\"What
> is an alpha level?\" as opposed to just \"Alpha level\" for example)
> and I want to start linking these entries to the appropriate
> categories in the topic list.
