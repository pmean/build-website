A recent publication

-   **Age-Specific Search Strategies for Medline**. Monika Kastner,
    Nancy L Wilczynski, Cindy Walker-Dilks, Kathleen Ann McKibbon, Brian
    Haynes. J Med Internet Res 2006 (Oct 25); 8(4):e25. [\[Full
    text\]](http://www.jmir.org/2006/4/e25/)

examines search strategies for articles relevant to geriatric medicine,
adult medicine, pediatric medicine, neonatal medicine, and obstetrics.
For studies of pediatric medicine, the most sensitive search used the
following terms:

-   child:.mp. OR adolescent.mp. OR infan:.mp.

which had a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 81%. The colon after
"child" tells MedLine to search for any word beginning with "child."
This allows you to search for either "child" or "children". The .mp
is a PubMed tag for multiple posting. It searches for terms that appear
in the title, abstract, or subject heading. The search that maximized
specificity was

-   children.tw

which had a specificity of 97% but a sensitivity of only 58%. The .tw is
a PubMed tag for text word, and will search for a word appearing in a
variety of locations.

*Includes all words and numbers in the title, abstract, other abstract,
MeSH terms, MeSH Subheadings, Publication Types, Substance Names,
Personal Name as Subject, MEDLINE Secondary Source, and Other Terms (see
Other Term \[OT\] above) typically non-MeSH subject terms (keywords),
including NASA Space Flight Mission, assigned by an organization other
than NLM.*

The best compromise was

-   adolescent.tw. OR children.tw. OR child, preschool.sh.

which produced 89% sensitivity and 87% specificity. The .sh is a PubMed
tag for MeSH subheading. MeSH is an acronym for Medical Subject Heading
and represents an effort by the coders at PubMed to classify the medical
specialties associated with the article being listed.

*NLM's Medical Subject Headings controlled vocabulary of biomedical
terms that is used to describe the subject of each journal article in
MEDLINE. MeSH contains more than 23,000 terms and is updated annually to
reflect changes in medicine and medical terminology. MeSH terms are
arranged hierarchically by subject categories with more specific terms
arranged beneath broader terms. PubMed allows you to view this hierarchy
and select terms for searching in the MeSH Database. Skilled subject
analysts examine journal articles and assign to each the most specific
MeSH terms applicable - typically ten to twelve. Applying the MeSH
vocabulary ensures that articles are uniformly indexed by subject,
whatever the author's words*.

What does sensitivity and specificity mean in the context of a Medline
search. The JMIR article explains it thusly:

*Sensitivity for a given age-specific topic is defined as the proportion
of relevant articles (ie, articles with the desired age-specific
content) that are retrieved; specificity is the proportion of
nonrelevant articles (ie, articles that are outside the desired
age-specific content) not retrieved*.
