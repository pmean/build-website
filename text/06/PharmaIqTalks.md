I may be giving a couple of talks for for
[PharmaIQ](http://www.iqpc.com/cgi-bin/templates/fivecell.html?topic=237&newTop=263),
a division of the [International Quality & Productivity Center
(IQPC)](http://www.iqpc.com). The first has the title "Signal Detection
Strategies for Paediatric Treatments" and the following for an
abstract:

*Signal detection and pharmacovigilance are already highly regulated and
challenging fields, but once you factor in children as your patient
group these challenges become even greater. There are physiologic,
ethical, and statistical questions that you must consider for some (but
not all) efforts in post marketing surveillance.*

*Discuss openly with your peers the issues that complicate drug safety
studies in children and recognise when these issues apply and when they
don't apply. Look at and debate the merits of alternative data sources,
research designs, and statistical analyses to balance the sometimes
conflicting needs of regulators, drug companies, and ethical review
boards.*

I've started outlining some of my thoughts about this talk at

-   [Stats: Special issues for research involving children (September
    15, 2006, Ethics, Overview)](ResearchInvolvingChildren.asp)

The second talk has the title "Control charts for continuous monitoring
of the number needed to harm." and the following for an abstract:

*While most of the efforts in signal detection use newly developed data
mining algorithms that are both complex and computer intensive, there is
still room in your research arsenal for simpler approaches that have
withstood the test of time, like the statistical process control chart.
By applying a straightforward data transformation, you can use the
control chart to monitor the Number Needed to Harm (NNH), an easily
interpreted measure of absolute risk.*

-   \*<U+FFFD>Identify those situations where simple control charts are
    preferable, but also recognize their risks and limitations.*
-   *Adapt different decision rules and alternate control chart formats
    to increase your sensitivity for small but consistent shifts in
    risk.*
-   *Establish rational targets for the NNH that balance the benefits of
    a new drug against its risks.*

I was also asked to provide a biographical sketch. Here's what I wrote:

*Steve Simon earned a Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Iowa in
1982. He currently works as a research biostatistician at Childrens
Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City, MO. He has co-authored over
60 peer reviewed publications in a variety of medical, scientific, and
statistical journals. He recently published a book, Statistical Evidence
in Medical Trials, through Oxford University Press. He is the architect
and designer of StATS (Steve's Attempt to Teach Statistics) a widely
cited web site with over one thousand pages and has contributed material
to two other prominent web sites: Chance News and Wikipedia.*
