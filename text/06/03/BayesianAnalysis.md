**[StATS]: Articles on Bayesian data analysis (March
30, 2006)**. [Category: Bayesian
statistics](../category/BayesianStatistics.html)

The [Journal of Data Science](http://www.sinica.edu.tw/~jds/index.html)
has a couple of interesting Bayesian papers in the [April 2006
issue](http://www.sinica.edu.tw/~jds/Content-v-4-2.html).

The first article addresses a thorny topic, multiple comparisons in an
ANOVA model.

-   **A Bayesian Approach to the Multiple Comparisons Problem.**
    Andrew A. Neath, Joseph E. Cavanaugh. Journal of Data Science 2006:
    4(2); 131-146.
    [\[Abstract\]](http://www.sinica.edu.tw/~jds/A266.html)
    [\[PDF\]](http://www.sinica.edu.tw/~jds/JDS-266.pdf) **(Model,
    Bayesian)**

The approach that Neath and Cavanaugh take is quite intriguing. Multiple
comparisons represent an effort to discern whether certain pairs of
means are different from one another or whether they are the same. You
can formulate this as a series of Bayesian models and exam the posterior
probabilities for these models. The authors also examine Bayesian model
averaging to produce estimates of individual means for each group.

The second article discusses the teaching of Bayesian statistics.

-   **Training Students and Researchers in Bayesian Methods.** Bruno
    Lecoutre. Journal of Data Science 2006: 4(2); 207-232.
    [\[Abstract\]](http://www.sinica.edu.tw/~jds/A246.html)
    [\[PDF\]](http://www.sinica.edu.tw/~jds/JDS-246.pdf) **(Model,
    Bayesian)**

This article is written from the perspective of someone who believes
that anyone who thinks carefully about statistics can\'t help but
abandon traditional frequentist methods because of their many flaws. The
language is quite blunt. Users of frequentist methods

> *must make \"judgmental adjustments\" or \"adaptative distorsions\"
> designed to make an ill-suited tool fit their true needs.*

Dr. Lecoutre advocates the use of non-informative priors and offers the
term \"Fiducial Bayesian\" to describe this approach. Although I dislike
the aggressive tone of this article, it is worth reading.
