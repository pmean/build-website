**[StATS]:** **Seminar notes, Creating More
Effective Graphics (March 24, 2006)**.

> I attended a web seminar, \"Creating More Effective Graphs,\" taught
> by Michael O\'Connell and Naomi Robbins and sponsored by Insightful
> Software, the makers of S-plus.\
> \
> Michael O\'Connell opened the talk with a brief description of Trellis
> graphics. It\'s hard to capture exactly what Trellis graphics are in
> words, but there is a nice web page by the developers of this product
> at Bell Labs
> [(stat.bell-labs.com/project/trellis](http://stat.bell-labs.com/project/trellis/)).\
> \
> Dr. O\'Connell also mentioned Graphlets. Graphlets are small java
> programs created by S-plus to produce highly interactive graphics that
> you can place on your web page. You can see some examples at
>

>     Insightful Software. Accessed on 2006-03-24. **(Model,
>     Descriptive)** \[Excerpt\] Here are just a few examples of S-PLUS
>     Graphlets. Some of the examples include the S source code used to
>     create the Graphlet, which you can use as a basis for creating
>     your own Graphlets.

> The choice of a graph form has a tremendous impact on your
> understanding of the data as well as your audience\'s understanding.
> One graph is more effective than another if the reader can extract
> quantitative information more rapidly. You should think about this
> definition of \"effective\" because it is not what most people would
> use. A commonly held conception is that a graphic is more effective if
> it grabs your attention more rapidly. In some contexts (e.g.,
> advertising) this might make sense but I believe that Dr. Robbins
> definition is preferred in most applications.\*
>
> Let me insert a personal comment here: Leland Wilkinson has an
> interesting take on this. He splits the types of tasks in a graph into
> two different categories, pattern recognition (discovering trends and
> associations), and table lookup (computing a numeric value from a
> graph). Some of the things that help with table lookup (grid lines,
> for example) will interfere with pattern recognition.
>
> Dot plots are an improvement over traditional bar charts, and this
> improvement is even more apparent when you use a clustered bar chart.
> By placing the dots side by side on the same scale, you see patterns
> more easily than with side by side bars. The panel display, placing
> several related graphs in a rectangular grid, is also an improvement
> over clustered and/or stacked bar charts. I don\'t have access to the
> graphs she used, but I will try to find or create comparable plots for
> this and all the other examples described here.\
> \
> Dr. Robbins talked about a \"month plot,\" also commonly called a
> cycle plot. It uses the S-plus command, monthplot. It is very useful
> way to display time series where you want to look at patterns across
> two different time scales. For example, you want to see the trend in
> sales over months, but you also are interested in variations in sales
> across days of the week.\
> \
> She showed a polar plot for a library survey where respondents were
> asked how the library was doing on a range of scales, what they
> thought was the minimum acceptable level and what was a desired level.
> An important consideration is when the perceived performance was lower
> than the minimum acceptable level or higher than the desired level.
> The polar plot used a cryptic color system (red means you failed to
> meet minimum acceptable level on average, for example). By plotting
> the minimum and desired values as a range, and placing a dot at the
> perceived level, you could easily see when the library was deficient
> (perceived level was lower than what was considered minimally
> acceptable, on average) and when the library was exceeding
> expectations (perceived level was higher than the desired level, on
> average).\
> \
> She also had a nice display of a 2\^4 factorial design. I\'m not sure
> what the name is for the type of plot she displayed, but I will find
> an example when I have time.\
> \
> The choice of color in graphics is important, and you need to keep in
> mind that some of your readers are color blind. There is a nice test
> for color blindness, and it includes a negative control (an image that
> even color blind patients can discern). I don\'t have Dr. Robbins\'
> image, but I think I found a copy of it on the web
> ([www.geocities.com/heartland/8833/coloreye.html](http://www.geocities.com/heartland/8833/coloreye.html))

> Dr. Robbins used these two colors in most of her plots because this
> choice of contrasting colors that will work well even for colorblind
> individuals.
>
> One of the questions at the end of the seminar was about how to best
> display data that has a three way interaction. It turns out that
> Richard Heiberger hasÂ  a book which discusses interaction plots in
> Chapters 12-13. I\'m guessing that the title of the book is
> Statistical Analysis and Data Display [\[BookFinder4U
> link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0387402705.html), which was
> co-authored with Burt Holland, but I don\'t have this book in my
> library, so I can\'t say for sure.
>
> \[Update, April 27, 2006\] I got a nice email from Dr. Robbins. She
> offered a minor correction (the title of her book is Creating More
> Effective Graphs, not Creating Effective Graphs) which I just fixed
> and confirmed that the Heiberger book \"Statistical Analysis and Data
> Display\" is indeed the book she was referring to.
