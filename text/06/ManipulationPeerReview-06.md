> I volunteered to give a talk at a local hospital, and the topic I'd

> pharmaceutical companies." It would cover some of the same material
> that was highlighted in Richard Smith's article in the Public Library
> of Science "Medical Journals Are an Extension of the Marketing Arm of
> Pharmaceutical Companies."\

> \
> I want to emphasize the empirical research that has been done in this
> area and highlight some recent scandals. As I develop the course, the
> materials will appear at
