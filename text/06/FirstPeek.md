**[StATS]: First peek at the cover of my new book
(January 12, 2006)**.

Oxford University Press (OUP) just sent me the first draft of the jacket
and cover of the book I am writing, Statistical Evidence in Medical
Trials.

Because of copyright issues, I will be removing some of the early drafts
of this book from my web pages soon, but OUP will let me keep some of
the material on the web. Also, I will work on revisions and updates of
the book for a possible second edition (a bit optimistic, perhaps, since
I don't know how well this book will sell).

I will revise my page

-   [Stats: Statistical Evidence](../evidence.asp)

in the next week or so and use that page to provide supplemental
materials, list any corrections, and so forth.
