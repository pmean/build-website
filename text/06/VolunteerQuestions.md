A regular contributor to the IRBForum (MG), wrote a nice list of
questions that a volunteer should ask before they decide to participate
in a clinical trial.

1.  Has this clinical trial been approved by an IRB?
2.  Has this physician been authorized by an IRB to conduct this trial?
3.  How do can I find out which IRB is overseeing this trial?

These are important questions and without mandatory registration of
clinical trials, it is unclear where a research volunteer would get
these answers.
