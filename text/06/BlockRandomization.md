Several people have asked me about block randomization, and while I
discuss it briefly on one of my web pages,

-   [Stats: Randomization](../plan/random.asp)

there is a better definition on the [Consort Statement web
site](http://www.consort-statement.org/) that defines several variations
of randomization including block randomization.

> *Blocking can be used to ensure close balance of the numbers in each

It is worth noting that a process that some people use, creating a
separate randomization list for different centers or for different
demographic groups in order to assure good balance across these
important factor, is actually stratified randomization and not block
randomization.
