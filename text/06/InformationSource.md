I have a brother-in-law who loves to debate politics and religion. He
always takes an aggressively conservative stand (I'm a flaming liberal,
but try not to mention politics too much on this weblog). Often he will
cite a "liberal" source, such as the New York Times to support his
arguments, and although he does not trust most of what is published in
these liberal sources, he will still cite them when they make a point in
favor of a conservative viewpoint. His rationale is when a liberal
source cites data supporting a conservative cause, they only do it
grudgingly and because the facts are too overwhelming to ignore.

I suppose I do the same thing myself, but with the politics reversed.
But this is a dangerous approach to take for several reasons.

1.  there are several dimensions to political beliefs\--libertarians,
    for example, have tendencies of both liberals (on drug laws) and
    conservatives (on tax policy).
2.  sometimes extreme liberals and extreme conservatives have the same
    motive for exaggerating a problem, since it helps generate publicity
    and/or political contributions.
3.  sometimes facts are unreliable for reasons other than politics.

Another problem with this approach is that it encourages cherry picking,
that is, the selective reporting of data that supports your cause. If
you read the New York Times for the supposedly rare tidbit of
conservative data and ignore all the other data, you end up just
mindlessly reinforcing your own perspective on life.

**Information sources in science**

The purpose of this weblog is not to debate politics, but to discuss
research methodology, but I think the same thing applies in scientific
circles. Critics of evolution, for example, will frequently take quotes
out of context that seems to sow doubt about the theory of evolution.
For example, a researcher might start out a paper with a statement like
"The Cambrian explosion presents the most challenging problem for the
theory of evolution"

The goal of this statement is to point out why research on the Cambrian
explosion is especially valuable, but a quote like this is paraded
around by the Intelligent Design community as proof that evolutionary
biologists know that evolution is a weak theory. There may be 100 quotes
stating the exact opposite, but the one quote is the only one that
matters.

Critics of evidence based medicine make the same mistake. They are fond
of citing a statistic that less than half, less than 25%, or less than
15% (the number varies) of all medical practices are based on solid
research. While there is indeed some data to suggest that a large
fraction of medicine is not based on solid research, there is more data
to suggest the opposite.

**Confirmation bias**

There's a closely related concept called confirmation bias, which is
the tendency to selectively remember evidence that supports your
hypothesis, but to ignore or forget or disregard evidence that refutes
your hypothesis.

This is not to say that you shouldn't consider the source as you
evaluate a fact. There is empirical evidence that conflicts of interest,
especially financial conflicts of interest, tend to lead to distortions
of the facts. I discuss conflict of interest in several places on my
weblog:

-   [Stats: What constitutes a conflict of interest? (May
    4, 2006)](ConflictOfInterest.html)
-   [Stats: More on conflicts of interest (March

**Intellectual conflict of interest**

Of special interest, is the so-called "intellectual conflict of
interest." A researcher was barred from an FDA review panel because he
had made some public comments that were critical of a certain drug and
manufacturer.

-   [www.nytimes.com/2004/11/13/politics/13fda.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/13/politics/13fda.html)
-   [bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/329/7476/1203](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/329/7476/1203)
-   [www.ahrp.org/infomail/04/11/15.php](http://www.ahrp.org/infomail/04/11/15.php)

Their rationale, I suspect, was to eliminate anyone who had "already
made up their minds about the problem" but researchers who had made
public comments defending the drug company were not similarly barred.
There were also researchers with financial conflicts of interest on the
same review panel, but these researchers received waivers.

A similar claim is that researchers who work for a federal agency or who
receive grants from federal agencies have a vested interest in
exaggerating the size of the problem that they are researching in order
to justify more government money for this area. This is an easy charge
to make and one that looks very attractive on its face, but there is no
empirical evidence to support this allegation.

**General guidelines**

So how should a conservative approach a liberal resource, and vice
versa? Here are some general guidelines.

-   **Read the whole article.** Don't stop when you've found the fact
    that supports your viewpoint. Are there any data, statistics, or
    facts in the same article that might contradict the fact that you
    are trying to use? Are you taking the facts out of context. Were the
    data collected to make a different point than the one you are trying
    to make?
-   **Play a what if game.** What if the fact that I am using ended up
    supporting the exact opposite conclusion. What criticisms might I
    tend to consider in this case? Make a regular habit of reading and
    critiquing viewpoints that you disagree with. Note the critiques
    that you use regularly in this exercise and apply them with equal
    vigor to the viewpoints that you agree with.
-   **Don't pretend that you understand the motivations of the
    writer**. You don't. No one is able to look into the soul of
    another person and discern their true intent. If you criticize a
    piece of data, do so based on overt and objective standards.

**But don't be too open-minded**

Most people who are avid liberals or conservatives don't fall into this
trap, but it is worth noting that you can sometimes be too lax and
uncritical of competing ideas. While you should pay serious attention to
ideas that disagree with your world view, you don't want to pretend
that all arguments for varying perspectives are equally valid. In most
situations, one side can marshal far stronger arguments for their
position than the other side can. It's not that they are better
debaters, but merely a recognition that there is more evidence and
supporting facts on one side.

It is a mistake to pretend that there is always a symmetry to the two
sides of an argument. The facts supporting a causal link between
vaccines and autism are very weak, and most of the data supports the
opposite view. So don't be too open-minded about opposing arguments.
