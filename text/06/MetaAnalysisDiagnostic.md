**[StATS]:** **Meta-analysis and diagnostic tests
(February 14, 2006)**

I will be giving a talk at the graduate seminar series for the
department of Mathematics and Statistics at UMKC on February 23. It will
be a combination of material from the following web pages:

-   [Statistical Evidence. Chapter 5.
    Meta-analysis](../evidence/Chapter05.html)
-   [Stats: Guidelines for meta-analysis
    models](../model/metaanalysis.asp)
-   [Definition:
    Sensitivity](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/sensitivity.htm)
-   [Definition:
    Specificity](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/specificity.htm)
-   [Stats: Meta-analysis for a diagnostic
    test](../model/diagnostic.asp)

The title of the talk will be "Meta-analysis and diagnostic tests."
and here is my abstract:

> Meta-analysis is the quantitative combination of results from multiple
> research studies. Meta-analysis is a relatively new field in
> Statistics, and standards for the proper data analysis are still
> evolving. Meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic tests, in particular,
> is especially controversial, with many conflicting approaches for
> computing an overall estimate from the individual sensitivity or
> specificity values from these studies. In the first half of this talk,
> I will review the general methods for the quantitative combination of
> results in a meta-analysis, and work out two examples using R and the
> meta library. In the second half, I will use data from a meta-analysis
> of 20 studies of endovaginal ultrasonography for detecting endometrial
> cancer to illustrate and critically evaluate several competing
> approaches for quantitatively combining results from diagnostic
> studies. All the data sets used in this presentation come from journal
> articles where the full free text is available on the web. A handout
> for this seminar can be found at
> [www.childrens-mercy.org/stats/training/hand67.asp](http://www.childrens-mercy.org/stats/training/hand67.asp).
