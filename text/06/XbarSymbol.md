**[StATS]:** **Placing the symbol X-bar in a
document (April 17, 2006)**

> Someone asked me how to place the symbol X-bar into a word processing
> document. This is tricky to do because there is nothing in the Symbol
> font that works and most word processing software allows for
> underlines but not overlines. I use a product called
> [MathType](http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/), but it might
> be too expensive for someone who only needs an occasional symbol or
> formula here and there. For the more casual user, there are several
> solutions:
>
> First, you can create a graphic image like this one:
![xbar01.gif not found.](../../../web/images/06/XbarSymbol01.png)
> you need that symbol. It\'s a bit tricky because you need to get the
> size and location just perfect and that is easier said than done. Part
> of the problem is that this graphic image has a few pixels around the
> border. You can see this more clearly when I use a gray background:
![xbar02.gif not found.](../../../web/images/06/XbarSymbol02.png)
> there are 25 pixels in height and there are three extra lines of
> pixels at the bottom and five extra lines of pixels at the top. I do
> seem to get better alignment if I remove most of the pixel border and
> used a smaller image, as I did here:
![xbar03.gif not found.](../../../web/images/06/XbarSymbol03.png)
> seems to fit in better. The problem, of course, is that if I change
> the font, what worked well for the original font would now work
> poorly.
>
> Second, you can use equation editor software that is available with
> some word processing software. The word processors produced by
> [Microsoft](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx) and by
> [OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org/) will allow you to create
> an X-bar fairly easily. Alignment is still a tricky issue.
>
> Third, you could rewrite your paper so as to avoid the use of the
> X-bar symbol entirely. This is the coward\'s way out, I realize, but
> how often is it really critical to use this particular symbol?
