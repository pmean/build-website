Someone asked me how to place the symbol X-bar into a word processing
document. This is tricky to do because there is nothing in the Symbol
font that works and most word processing software allows for
underlines but not overlines. I use a product called
[MathType](http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/), but it might
be too expensive for someone who only needs an occasional symbol or
formula here and there. For the more casual user, there are several
solutions:

First, you can create a graphic image like this one:
![xbar01.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/06/XbarSymbol01.png)
you need that symbol. It's a bit tricky because you need to get the
size and location just perfect and that is easier said than done. Part
of the problem is that this graphic image has a few pixels around the
border. You can see this more clearly when I use a gray background:
![xbar02.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/06/XbarSymbol02.png)
there are 25 pixels in height and there are three extra lines of
pixels at the bottom and five extra lines of pixels at the top. I do
seem to get better alignment if I remove most of the pixel border and
used a smaller image, as I did here:
![xbar03.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/06/XbarSymbol03.png)
seems to fit in better. The problem, of course, is that if I change
the font, what worked well for the original font would now work
poorly.

Second, you can use equation editor software that is available with
some word processing software. The word processors produced by
[Microsoft](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx) and by
[OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org/) will allow you to create
an X-bar fairly easily. Alignment is still a tricky issue.

Third, you could rewrite your paper so as to avoid the use of the
X-bar symbol entirely. This is the coward's way out, I realize, but
how often is it really critical to use this particular symbol?
