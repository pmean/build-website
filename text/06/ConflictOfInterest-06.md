**[StATS]:** **What constitutes a conflict of
interest? (May 4, 2006)**

> I am a member of a committee that helps researchers set up Data Safety
> and Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) for research projects at Kansas
> University Medical Center (KUMC). The typical study that we would help
> set up DSMBs for would be small scale single center trials. We
> recommended that the typical DSMB have two specialists in the medical
> area of the research and a statistician. We ask the principal
> investigator to nominate the two specialists.
>
> Some debate ensued about whether the specialists nominated by the
> principal investigator would have a conflict of interest because they
> presumably would know and would have worked with the principal
> investigator.
>
> Conflict of interest is a tricky thing, and sometimes I think people
> apply the term without thinking carefully about it. I believe that
> anyone with a financial stake in the outcome of a clinical trial
> should not sit on the DSMB and make decisions about possible early
> termination of the trial. Also individuals with a close professional
> affiliation need to be excluded. For example, a researcher who has
> co-authored research papers with the principal investigator should be
> excluded. But you can't start excluding people because they know each
> other or because one regularly refers patients to the other or because
> they attended the same medical school. Once you start down that road,
> you may find it impossible to find anyone who does not have a
> conflict.
>
> There is no easy answer, though, for where you would draw the line. A
> general rule is<U+FFFD> that the more transparent and replicable the research
> process is, the less you have to worry about a conflict of interest.
> So, for example, you might accept a meta-analysis from a group that
> has a financial stake in the outcome, but not an invited editorial.
