A member of our local IRB forwarded a press release announcing new
software that would revolutionize the conduct of clinical trials. The
company is called Analytical Edge and they offer a software program
called Pure Likelihood. There is only a limited amount of information at
the website:

-   [www.analyticaledge.com](http://www.analyticaledge.com/)

But the web page of one of the founders of the company, Jeffrey Blume,
includes some talks and papers about the topic. The basic thrust is that
the p-value is not a good tool for making decisions about whether a drug
is safe and/or efficacious, and it should be replaced with the
likelihood ratio. The best paper

-   **Likelihood methods for measuring statistical evidence.** J. D.
    Blume. Stat Med 2002: 21(17); 2563-99.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12205699&dopt=Abstract)

    **(Model, Likelihood)**

is well worth reading. The likelihood ratio is much more nimble at
capturing information appropriate for interim analyses, for example.

Dr. Blume is not the first to criticize the p-value, and some
interesting links if you want to explore this further are listed below.
