**[StATS]:** **Software for structural equations
models (March 14, 2006)**. [Category: Statistical
computing](../category/StatisticalComputing.html)

A recent email on the
[Medstats](http://groups.google.com/group/MedStats) discussion group
discussed software for structural equations models. Some of the packages
mentioned were:

-   AMOS,
    [www.assess.com/Software/AMOS.htm](http://www.assess.com/Software/AMOS.htm)
-   EQS, [www.mvsoft.com/](http://www.mvsoft.com/)
-   LISREL,
    [www.ssicentral.com/lisrel/index.html](http://www.ssicentral.com/lisrel/index.html)
-   MPLUS, [www.statmodel.com](http://www.statmodel.com)
-   Mx, [www.vcu.edu/mx/](http://www.vcu.edu/mx/)

You can find a lot of information about these software programs and
about structural equations models, in general, at the [SEMNET
archives](http://bama.ua.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=semnet&D=1&H=0&O=D&T=1) and
the [Ed Rigdon\'s SEMENT FAQ](http://www2.gsu.edu/~mkteer/semfaq.html).
