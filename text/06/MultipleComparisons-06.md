One of the talks at the 18th Annual Applied Statistics in Agriculture Conference, sponsored by Kansas State University was "A Comparison of Multiple Tests Procedures: Spinosad as a Treatment for Lice on Cattle" by Zhanglin Cui, Eli Lilly and Company. Daniel H. Mowrey, Alan G. Zimmermann, and Douglas E. Hutchens, also of Eli Lilly and Company were co-authors.

I have a web page that discusses many of these same issues:

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [old website][sim2].
