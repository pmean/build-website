multiple comparisons (created 2006-07-17)**.

> One of the talks at the 18th Annual Applied Statistics in Agriculture
> Conference, sponsored by Kansas State University was \"A Comparison of
> Multiple Tests Procedures: Spinosad as a Treatment for Lice on
> Cattle\" by Zhanglin Cui, Eli Lilly and Company. Daniel H. Mowrey,
> Alan G. Zimmermann, and Douglas E. Hutchens, also of Eli Lilly and
> Company were co-authors.
