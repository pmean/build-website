> I volunteered to be the new chair of the Traveling Course committee of
> the American Statistical Association (ASA). The ASA recruits speakers
> who offer a one day course on an important topic in Statistics and
> then offers the course to three local ASA chapters that are in
> reasonably close proximity (that gets a bit tricky for some of the
> chapters in the western United States). The ASA pays the speaker
> honorarium and the airline costs while the local chapter pays the
> hotel and meals. Typically, the local chapter will re-imburse the
> national office for \$25 per attendee. Local chapters typically charge
> more than \$25 to each attendee to recoup their costs, though some
> will also subsidize the cost for full-time students.
>
> It's a nice program that helps the local chapters enhance the quality
> of programs that they offer and it usually makes some money for both
> the local chapter and the national chapter.
>
> The committee met during the Joint Statistics Meetings last week. The
> vice chairs of each district have been asked to either serve on this
> committee or designate someone to serve. This will insure good
> geographical representation on the committee.
>
> There are several topics and speakers that we will pursue for the
> upcoming year. When we get two volunteers (maybe three) to teach for
> the traveling course, we will send out a call to all the chapters to
> apply for one or both of the classes. We will give priority to
> chapters that have not had a traveling course recently.
>
> Next year, I suggested that we move the process up by a few months so
> that a speaker would be selected in June or July and announced at the
> Council of Chapters meeting at the JSM meeting in August. This would
> allow chapters to work a traveling course into their schedule for the
> fall.
>
> I also think that we need to describe the details of the traveling
> course on the ASA website. There is already a set of pages for the
> LearnSTAT courses,
