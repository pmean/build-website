> interesting statistic and indicates that I have accumulated a lot of
> content since I started these pages in 1998. The weblog, which I
> started in 2004 has about a third of all of the pages. There are also
> about 1,300 graphic images on these pages, mostly screen shots of SPSS
> and formulas produced by MathType.
