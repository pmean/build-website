> When you do a global search and replace in Frontpage, it offers a page
> count of all the pages that it searches. Sometime in the past month, I
> exceeded one thousand pages. Some of these pages very small and other
> pages are compilations of existing web pages. Still, that is an
> interesting statistic and indicates that I have accumulated a lot of
> content since I started these pages in 1998. The weblog, which I
> started in 2004 has about a third of all of the pages. There are also
> about 1,300 graphic images on these pages, mostly screen shots of SPSS
> and formulas produced by MathType.
