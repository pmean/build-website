    Web
    \[PDF\]](http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/googlescholar/EBMJan20_06.pdf)**.

    Clincial Evidence - BMJ, ACP Journal Club, eMedicine, National
    Guideline Clearinghouse, Canadian Medical Association Clinical
    Practice Guideline Database, Bandolier, NeLH-HS Guidelines Finder,
    Evidence-based medicine (BMJ), Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy,
    ACP Medicine, BestBETS, UK Centre for REviews and Dissemination,
    InfoPOEMS, University of Laval - KUUC, National Quality Measures
    Clearinghouse, Medscape, and DynaMed.
