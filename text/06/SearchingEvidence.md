While the title seems to limit the range of searching to the Google
Scholar search engine
([scholar.google.com/](http://scholar.google.com/)), the topics are
actually quite varied and interesting. One entry in particular,

-   **[Top 20 (or so) Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) Sources on the Open
    Web
    \[PDF\]](http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/googlescholar/EBMJan20_06.pdf)**.

    \[My comments\] An excellent list of places on the web where you can
    find EBM resources. The list includes UpToDate, PubMed, Cochrane,
    Clincial Evidence - BMJ, ACP Journal Club, eMedicine, National
    Guideline Clearinghouse, Canadian Medical Association Clinical
    Practice Guideline Database, Bandolier, NeLH-HS Guidelines Finder,
    Evidence-based medicine (BMJ), Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy,
    ACP Medicine, BestBETS, UK Centre for REviews and Dissemination,
    InfoPOEMS, University of Laval - KUUC, National Quality Measures
    Clearinghouse, Medscape, and DynaMed.
