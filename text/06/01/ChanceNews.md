> > better understanding of chance news as reported by the media and to
> > allow teachers of probability and statistics courses to liven up
> > their courses with current news. From 1992 to 2004, Chance News was
> > written by a small number of regular contributors. These are
> > archived on the [Chance Website](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance)
> > where you will also find other resources for teaching a probability
> > or statistic course.*

> > *Chance News is now a \"Wiki\". A Wiki is a web site designed to
> > allow readers to easily add contributions or edit existing
> > contributions. This makes it collaborative effort of its readers in
> > the spirit of the very successful free encyclopedia
> > [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). (The word wiki
