> I took a three day workshop on grant writing and prepared a draft

> format that I need to use, but it outlines most of the goals and
> efforts of my proposed work. Here's what I wrote:
>
> As the research biostatistician at Children's Mercy, Dr. Simon has
> supported the development of literally hundreds of clinical trials
> across just about every branch of pediatric medicine. In his
> experience and in the experience of many of the people he works with,
> the greatest practical problem in conducting medical research is slow
> accrual of patients. Clinical trials invariably have problems
> recruiting the planned number of patients in a reasonable time frame.
> According to one source1, more than 80% of all clinical trials fall
> short of their accrual goals. The net result is too many research
> studies that appear with inadequate sample sizes and confidence
> intervals that are so wide that they are effectively uninterpretable.
>
> The problem of inadequate accrual is a serious issue for Institutional
> Review Boards (IRBs). If a study has an inadequate accrual rate, that
> changes the balance of risks and benefits. The patients that are
> enrolled in the study experience inconvenience and possibly pain, and
> may even suffer increased risk but do not provide information with
> sufficient precision to produce scientifically valid results. The NIH

> Foundations and government agencies that support medical research
> directly bear the costs of a study with poor accrual rates. When they
> invest their limited funds in such a project, this represents money
> taken away from a different research project that would have met its
> accrual goals and would have provided scientifically useful output.
> The amount of research money tied up in these underperforming clinical
> trials represents a huge lost opportunity cost that dilutes the
> effectiveness of the agency's grant program.

> Although slow accrual rates are a serious threat to the overall
> research endeavor, they are treated like the crazy aunt in the attic.
> No one talks about slow accrual rates, and no one does anything about
> them, and everyone wishes they would just go away.
>
> The goal (long range objective) of this research program is to
> increase the awareness in the research community that accrual problems
> are a serious threat to the research endeavor and to understand the
> factors that cause problems with patient accrual. This will serve as
> preliminary data in the background and significance section of an NIH
> R03 or R21 grant to produce quantitative tools for planning and
> monitoring accrual rates in clinical trials.
>
> Specific Aim \#1. Estimate the proportion of studies approved by the
> Children's Mercy IRB between 2001 and 2004 that have experienced
> delays in the completion of the studies because of accrual rates
> problems or which ended without recruiting the original planned number
> patients.
>
> During months 1 and 2, identify a sampling frame of IRB studies. At
> this point, the sampling frame will be broad and inclusive. Any
> prospective study that uses human subjects will be entered into a
> database.
>
> During months 3 and 4, obtain and review the research protocol
> submitted to the IRB and scan it for the following eligibility
> requirements:
>
> 1.  Both a target sample size and a time frame for completion of the
>     study are clearly stated in the research protocol.
> 2.  The specified time frame must be long term (at least 12 months)
>     but short enough so that the estimated completion date would occur
>     before December 2005.
> 3.  A study that is still open is eligible for review as long as the
>     target completion date would have been prior to December 2005.
>
> An important statistic computed at this point is the proportion of all
> prospective studies that fail to specify a completion date. These
> represent studies where an important component of the research plan is
> left out.
>
> During months 4-6, obtain all interim reports and final reports
> submitted to the IRB for studies identified in the previous step.
> Estimate the accrual rate at each reporting point and calculate
> whether it is behind schedule, on time, or ahead of schedule. For
> those studies with a final report, calculate the proportion that
> finished with fewer than the originally planned number of subjects and
> the average percentage shortfall in these studies.
>
> Specific Aim \#2. Evaluate the reasons (and excuses) that are offered
> in interim and final reports in those studies with identified accrual
> problems.
>
> During months 7-9, among those studies identified as being behind
> schedule at an interim report, identify any text in that report that
> offers an explanation for the delay or which offers a proposed change
> to help get the study back on track. Perform the same task for any
> study with a final report that ended later than planned.
>
> Also during months 7-9, among those studies that finished with fewer
> than the planned number of subjects, identify any text in that report
> that offers an explanation for the shortfall.
>
> During months 10-12, an independent reviewer will read the textual

> represent a small and manageable set of discrete responses that
> captures the full range of textual responses. Two reviewers will then
> take that list of categories and independently assign individual text
> items to one or more of these categories. The degree of agreement
> among the reviewers will be estimated and the reviewers will meet to
> resolve any discordance between the two classifications.

> Evaluation. The results of these quantitative and qualitative analyses

> nature and frequency of responses offered when a clinical trial fall
> behind schedule. These IRB members will be asked if this is consistent
> with their experience and if any important issues have been left

> **Executive summary**. As the research biostatistician at Children's
> Mercy, Dr. Simon has supported the development of literally hundreds
> of clinical trials across just about every branch of pediatric
> medicine. In his experience and in the experience of many of the
> people he works with, the greatest practical problem in conducting
> medical research is slow accrual of patients. It is not unusual to see
> a research project that has gone a full year past its completion date
> and yet the researcher still has less than half of the subjects
> originally planned for. Slow accrual causes serious difficulty for
> researchers, for groups that fund research, and for groups that review
> research, such as Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Data and
> Safety Monitoring Committees.
>
> There is little appreciation, however, in the research community for
> the problem caused by slow patient accrual. This lack of concern is
> caused, in large part, by the lack of hard data on scope and magnitude
> of the problem with slow patient accrual. This research proposal asks
> for \$15,000 for a pilot study to evaluate a random sample of 100
> studies approved by the Children's Mercy IRB. This sample will
> produce an estimate of the proportion of studies that fall behind
> schedule, the proportion that end with fewer patients than originally
> planned, and the average shortfall in those studies. A qualitative
> analysis of the interim and final reports will help identify the major
> factors that cause slow patient accrual. The results of this research
> will serve as preliminary data for an R03 or R21 grant to produce
> quantitative tools for planning and monitoring accrual rates in
> clinical trials. These tools will help researchers plan appropriate
> and realistic accrual rates and monitor them regularly, so that
> corrective action can be taken early to get a study back on track.

> The teacher laughed at the "crazy aunt in the attic" analogy, but
