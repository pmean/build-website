>
> Wolfgang Schurman from Schering AG presented a talk, "Developing
> Successful Long-Term Drug Safety Strategies for an Uncertain Future".
>
> > Most regulatory changes in the review of drugs occurred as the
> > result of medical disasters, such as the death of ten children from
> > a contaminated tetanus vaccine in 1902, and the birth defects caused
> > by Thalidomide in the 1950s,
> >
> > Some of the recent regulations such as
> > [726/2004](http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/review/doc/final_publ/reg_2004_726_20040430_en.pdf)
> > and
> > [2001/83/EC](http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/eudralex/vol-1/dir_2001_83/dir_2001_83_en.pdf)
> > speak to new safety reporting requirements.
> >
> > The IOM report ["The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and
> > Protecting the Health of the Public"](http://www.iom.edu/?id=37339)
> > came up with four conclusions:
> >
> > -   we have a safety crisis
> > -   we recognize that all drug companies want to change
> > -   we need to sort out who is responsible for what
> > -   we need to improve communication
> >
> > There is an uncertain future because new products have a widely
> > unknown safety profile, new and stricter regulations, more
> > inspections, a huge number of cases, huge databases but with poor
> > quality. We live in an era of instant communication because of the
> > Internet and we need to be proactive when possible and respond
> > immediately when unexpected problems occur.
> >
> > Goals are to provide safe medicine, avoid safety crises, avoid
> > unjustified recalls, avoid legal claims, and avoid negative
> > inspection outcomes. All of this must be done while limiting the
> > inevitable increase in cost and resources.
> >
> > Pharmacovigilance staff need to be adequately resourced, staffed,
> > and trained. They need a thorough knowledge of the literature,
> > epidemiology principles, and the company's products. The department
> > needs to be independent and report directly to a board member rather
> > than be subordinate to marketing or medical affairs. You also need
> > an optimal IT environment (e.g., e-reporting, image storing, and
> > document management system).
> >
> > Dr. Schurman criticized the 7/15 day reporting timelines as being
> > unrealistic in a global environment with multiple organizations
> > involved with research. He also stressed the need to harmonize and
> > simplify regulations. You also need to concentrate on the important
> > cases rather than get lost in a sea of information.
>
> William Maier, Director of Epidemiology at Elan Ltd, talked about "A
> Combinatorial Approach to Signal Detection for Respiratory Adverse
> Reactions"
>
> > He summarized the new EU risk management plan
> > ([www.emea.eu.int/pdfs/human/euleg/9626805en.pdf](http://www.emea.eu.int/pdfs/human/euleg/9626805en.pdf)).

> > Dr. Maier's approach was what to do when a signal is detected.
> > Where can epidemiology help you?
> >
> > -   Event classification-are you only seeing the severe tip of an
> >     epidemic?
> > -   Severity of the problem-what is the predicted prognosis?
> > -   Extrapolating to a larger population-how many people are
> >     actually affected?
> > -   Incorporating other data sources-can you predict risk using data
> >     from other drugs?
> > -   Evaluating other risk factors-is it a real association or is it
> >     spurious?.
> > -   Evaluation of risk prevention activities-did they really work?
> >
> > The objective is very critical. Are you trying to generate signals
> > or testing a formal hypothesis?
> >
> > Dr. Maier offered an interesting case study: a novel pill based
> > therapy is in Phase III trials. Two unusual side effects are
> > noted-patients who suffer from a rare condition called Churg-Strauss
> > Syndrome (CSS). To investigate this further, he reviewed various
> > databases to characterize the background rate of CSS in the general
> > population, to note that all cases of CSS occur in patients with
> > asthma, and that certain existing drugs for treating asthma have an
> > increased risk for CSS compared to other drugs. There are many
> > limitations to the inferences that you can draw from these
> > databases, and Dr. Maier outlined these limitations.
>
> Ulrich Vogel from Boehringer Ingelheim talked about "Best Practices
> for Combining Manual and Medical Opinion With Statistical Analysis."
>
> > He applied a general sociological concept known as "the wisdom of
> > crowds". He cited work by a famous statistician, Sir Francis Galton
> > who witnessed a crowd at a county fair estimating the weight of an
> > ox on display. The crowd included both cattle experts and lay
> > persons. Each participant wrote their estimate of weight on a card.
> > Dr. Galton was trying to show the mediocrity of a crowd estimate,
> > but when he computed the average of all the estimates, it was closer
> > to the true weight than even the best of the individual guesses.
> >
> > The key criteria for the wisdom of crowds to work is that you need a
> > true diversity of opinion, independence of individual opinions, the
> > ability to draw on local knowledge, and<U+FFFD> some mechanism for creating
> > a consensus estimate.
> >
> > CIOMS III presented the five axis model for evaluation of safety
> > signals: mechanism, temporal relationship, dose relationship,
> > reproducibility, and distinction from background rate.
> >
> > If you get a signal, before you investigate further, ask four
> > questions.
> >
> > **Is it evaluable?** For example, the limitations of a database may
> > be so severe that a signal is effectively uninformative.
> >
> > **Is it homogenous?** For example, a complaint of weight gain might
> > represent a mix of increased appetite and water retention.
> >
> > **How does it break down?** For example, is there a specific
> > demographic group that predominantly produces a set of adverse event
> > reports.
> >
> > **How conclusive is your result?**
> >
> > Spontaneous reports do have many limitations, but they do deliver
> > the perceived profile. They tell you what the public, the
> > regulators, and the media are thinking.
> >
> > Cross database comparisons are valuable because they increase
> > diversity and appease concerns about limitations of an individual
> > database.
>
> Nawab Qizilbash from Oxon Clinical Epidemiology gave a talk, "Signal
> Matching: Managing and Monitoring Databases."
>
> > His outline covered the following topics: key factors in choosing a
> > database, comparing accessible databases, matching signal types to
> > the appropriate database, requirements for properly using databases,
> > and maintaining the knowledge and training to make informed
> > decisions.
> >
> > Internal data sources include company trials (as summarized by
> > meta-analysis) and spontaneous reports. External sources of data
> > include spontaneous reports, safes data, government statistics,
> > hospital-based data, large medical practice databases, large medical
> > and/or pharmacy claims databases, population based studies, patient
> > registrics, patient based studies, and surveys.
> >
> > The method of detection depends greatly on the frequency of events.
> > Clinical trials can detect rates of 1 in 10, in 100, or maybe 1 in
> > 1,000. Registries are better at detecting more rare events, such as
> > 1 in 5,000, but to detect really rare events you need
> > epidemiological methods (such as case-control designs) or
> > spontaneous reports.
> >
> > If you are choosing a database, you need to understand your
> > objective (detection, investigation, or monitoring), your target
> > population, the rarity and severity of the event, the comparison
> > group, completeness of ascertainment, validity of the source, data
> > quality, size of the database, timing, costs, and geography.
> >
> > Differences in geographical prescribing practices are an important
> > consideration. Your consideratons change if your drug is novel or a
> > member of an existing class of drugs. You should also factor in
> > whether your drug is on the market or still in development.
> >
> > External spontaneous reporting databases include the [FDA
> > AERS](http://www.fda.gov/cder/aers/default.htm), and
> > [WHO-UMC](http://www.who-umc.org/DynPage.aspx) (76 countries).
> >
> > Epidemiological databases can be split into medical practice
> > databases, claims databases, and prospective patient registries.
> > Data could be aggregated or at the patient-level. It can be
> > cross-sectional or longitudinal. Some examples of these databases
> > are the [General Practice Research
> > Database](http://www.gprd.com/home/) (UK),
> > [THIN](http://www.nvug.org/nvugall/nvugany/thin.htm) (UK), Medplus
> > (UK, France, Germany), and Thales (France). The U.S. has a large
> > number of HMO databases that are useful for pharmacovigilance.
> >
> > He highlighted an interesting example of an association that was
> > noted with prescription of a statin (presumably for heart disease)
> > and reduced rates of dementia. A re-analysis showed a strange dose
> > response pattern, though. The protective effect was strongest in
> > those patients who had been taking the drug the least amount of time
> > and the effect more or less disappeared among patients taking the
> > drug for several years. This is an example of prescription bias. If
> > a patient comes into a doctor's office showing signs of memory
> > problems and forgetfulness, the doctor may be reluctant to add on a
> > new drug, especially if it is for prevention of a future illness
> > rather than the treatment of a current illness.
> >
> > The expertise needed for a good safety review include an
> > epidemiologist with significant clinical experience, a programmer
> > who is not afraid of dirty data, and a statistician who can
> > appreciate the special issues of observational data.
>
> Pauline Gerritsen-van Schieveen from Astellas presented a talk, "Risk
> Management and Signal Detection in the Real Life of a Middle Size
> Company."
>
> > She stressed the need to start risk assessment before the
> > first-in-man study. You can identify potential issues from the
> > pre-clinical data. This assessment is done by the toxicologist.
> > There is also a competitor analysis (what are the safety problems of
> > other compounds in the same therapeutic class).
> >
> > For every identified or potential or theoretical risk, a risk
> > minimization plan is written. Every risk needs systematic follow-up.
> > Every bit of new information needs to be assessed to check for new
> > potential issues or for relevant information on previously
> > identified issues. If new potential issues are identified, the risk
> > minimization plan is updated appropriately.
> >
> > Some possible updates are changes in inclusion/exclusion criteria,
> > or a change in safety parameters or in the frequency of sampling.
> > Some data may require immediate action (e.g., fatal or
> > life-threatening adverse events). Risk management processes need a
> > direct link with crisis management.
> >
> > Dr. Gerritsen-van Scieveen's company has seen some major changes
> > after the creation of a risk management group. There was a company
> > wide update of terminology to reflect appreciation of risk
> > management issues, closer cooperation with the exploratory
> > development group, an update of quality system documents, and the
> > reservation of more time for risk management. The company also
> > started the development of an EMEA mandated risk management plan
> > very early in the process. The company is also considering that more
> > time ought to be spent on post marketing pharmacovigilance and less
> > time in clinical development.
> >
> > Inspectors are common in the pharmaceutical industry and they are
> > looking for specific things in risk management. First they ask for a
> > rational process for determining the frequency of safety
> > evaluation-once a year is not enough. Second, they are looking for
> > documentation of the risk management process and proof that the
> > documented process is actually being followed.

> It's hard to take good notes, so I apologize to the speakers if I did
