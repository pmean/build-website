**[StATS]:** **The danger of using humor on a web
page (November 14, 2006)**. [Category: Website
details](../category/WebsiteDetails.html)

> I got a nice email yesterday from someone who had read my web page
> with a definition of a retrospective study.
>
> -   [Definition: Retrospective
>     Study](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/retrospective.htm)
>
> I had made a humorous comment about the difficulties with prospective
> studies.
>
> > *A prospective study is slow. The subjects are uncooperative and
> > refuse to die fast enough to make our study successful.*
>
> The person who read that page suggested that the comment was
> insensitive and possibly hurtful for someone who was researching their
> own child's illness. She pointed out that some level of humor is
> probably needed for a dry topic, but that this comment was "*more
> likely to offend than to amuse.*"
>
> It's worth keeping in mind that when you make a humorous comment that
> is taken the wrong way in a live seminar, you have the opportunity to
> immediately qualify the statement. But on a web page, unless the
> person reading it is nice enough to offer some feedback, you will
> never know and never have the opportunity to correct your error.
>
> I rewrote the comment:
>
> > *A prospective study is slow. Unless you are studying a rapidly
> > fatal disease, you have to wait years or even decades to accumulate
> > sufficient data to draw any strong conclusions.*
>
> and I hope that is better.

> The point that wanted to make is an important one. Often the needs of
> the research study is at odds with what everyone really wants. Anytime
> you are studying a discrete event, you need to accumulate about 25 to
> 50 of these events in each group in order to get reasonable power and
> precision. Most of the "events" that we study in research are bad
> things, like death, relapse, device failure. You need to plan the
> research carefully so that you study a large enough group of patients
> for a long enough period of time so that you do get a sufficient
> number of these bad events happening. If you study mortality in a
> group of ten thousand patients, and in one group four patients die and
> in the other group only two patients die, you have indeed seen a
> doubling of mortality risk, but it is impossible to declare anything
> about a data set with only six total deaths.
>
> Researchers will often start their research programs in patients who
> are most seriously ill for just this reason. A group of patients who
> are seriously ill are more likely to experience bad events like
> re-hopsitalization, and provide you with the sort of precision that
> you need to make meaningful statements about risk.
