**[StATS]: Upcoming talks about control charts
(created 2006-05-25)**.

I am working on some ideas for a grant to use control charts to track
adverse events in clinical trials. I also envision the possibility of
using control charts as a warning of a sudden influx of events that may
be an early indicator of a bioterrorism event. I have not fleshed out
these ideas very completely yet, but hope to do so soon in the weblog.

While reviewing the upcoming talks at the Joint Statistics Meeting in
Seattle, August 2006, I noticed several interesting talks that appear to
be related to some of the things I might be working on.
