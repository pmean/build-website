> A recent discussion on the [Evidence-Based Health email discussion
> group](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/EVIDENCE-BASED-HEALTH.html)
> focused on the word "risk". It means harmful event (risks versus
> benefits) as well as a probability (risk of heart attack). So when you
> are defining evidence based medicine, it worthwhile to describe how it
> allows you to assess the benefits and harms of a new therapy and the
> probability of those benefits and harms. That avoids some confusion
> over the interpretation of the word "risk".
