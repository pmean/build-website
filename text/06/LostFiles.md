> a disaster.
>
> 1\. Store your data files on a network folder. If your network is like
> mine, it is run by people who know how to protect data, both from
> accidental loss, and from attacks from malicious hackers.
>
> 2\. If you make changes to your data, allow for a way to gracefully back
> up to a previous version. You may regret your changes later. I use a
> series of names, either with a sequence number (atopic01.txt,
> atopic02.txt, etc.) or with an encoded date (web060315.zip,
> web060401.zip). I like to use a yymmdd format or a yyyymmdd format for
> encoded dates because then they sort well.
>
> 3\. Document your data with such details as the units of measurement and
> the meanings of various categories. There are ways to make a data set
> self-documenting, but you could also just keep an extra sheet of paper
> or a file that has this information.
>
> 4\. Have one person who is clearly "in charge." Anyone who assists
> needs to be sure that when they are working on the data entry, that the
> things they are doing do not clash with person in charge. Don't have
> two people doing data entry at the same time unless you have set up a
> database that is formally designed for multiple users.
>
> 5\. Some programs will only pull up a single record of data at a time and
> if a power glitch strikes your computer, you never lose more than that
> single record. Other programs have an autosave feature (be sure you turn
> this on) that saves the file you are working on at predefined intervals.
> If your software for data entry has neither of these features, get in
> the habit of saving your data every five minutes or so.
>
> I regularly counsel people who have lost data (fortunately, the loss
> of a LARGE amount of data is fairly rare). It's impossible to develop
> a system that is perfect, but if you are regularly finding yourself
> having to retype data, it might be worthwhile to talk about improving
> your data entry system.
