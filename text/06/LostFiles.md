**[StATS]:** **Lost files (May 23, 2006)**
[Category: Data management](../category/DataManagement.html)

> I work on these web pages from my desktop computer and two different
> laptop computers. I also have an Administrative Assistant who will
> sometimes update my web pages from her computer. In the middle of all
> of this, I ended up copying an old file on top of a new files and lost
> several weblog entries. With a bit of effort, I did find them in a
> backup zip file that I had made last week.
>
> I think this is a sign that I am too busy and my life is too
> complicated. I need to create a foolproof system for entering weblog
> items, but it helps to keep in mind the following quote.

> > "*Every day, man is making bigger and better fool-proof things, and

> I advise people all the time on how to set up a fool proof data entry
> system, and while you can't anticipate all of the possible things
> that can go wrong, here are some things that can sometimes help avert
> a disaster.
>
> 1\. Store your data files on a network folder. If your network is like
> mine, it is run by people who know how to protect data, both from
> accidental loss, and from attacks from malicious hackers.
>
> 2\. If you make changes to your data, allow for a way to gracefully back
> up to a previous version. You may regret your changes later. I use a
> series of names, either with a sequence number (atopic01.txt,
> atopic02.txt, etc.) or with an encoded date (web060315.zip,
> web060401.zip). I like to use a yymmdd format or a yyyymmdd format for
> encoded dates because then they sort well.
>
> 3\. Document your data with such details as the units of measurement and
> the meanings of various categories. There are ways to make a data set
> self-documenting, but you could also just keep an extra sheet of paper
> or a file that has this information.
>
> 4\. Have one person who is clearly "in charge." Anyone who assists
> needs to be sure that when they are working on the data entry, that the
> things they are doing do not clash with person in charge. Don't have
> two people doing data entry at the same time unless you have set up a
> database that is formally designed for multiple users.
>
> 5\. Some programs will only pull up a single record of data at a time and
> if a power glitch strikes your computer, you never lose more than that
> single record. Other programs have an autosave feature (be sure you turn
> this on) that saves the file you are working on at predefined intervals.
> If your software for data entry has neither of these features, get in
> the habit of saving your data every five minutes or so.
>
> I regularly counsel people who have lost data (fortunately, the loss
> of a LARGE amount of data is fairly rare). It's impossible to develop
> a system that is perfect, but if you are regularly finding yourself
> having to retype data, it might be worthwhile to talk about improving
> your data entry system.
