Over the weekend, I wrote three new koans.

-   [Stats: Koan 05, The Bowl of Wax Fruit](../koans/WaxFruit.asp)
-   [Stats: Koan 06, The Busy Tailor](../koans/BusyTailor.asp)
-   [Stats: Koan 07, Some Useless Gifts](../koans/UselessGifts.asp)

Two of these were inspired by a short course I took on Friday on
Bayesian statistics. I will probably write some entries in my weblog
based on other things I learned in this course.
