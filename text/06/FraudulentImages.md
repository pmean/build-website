**[StATS]:** **Fraudulent images in research (July
12, 2006)**

Fraud in research is a big problem. One issue that has come up recently
is that graphical images can be \"Photoshopped\" to present the image in
a way that does not truly represent how the original research was done.
Photoshop is a very useful program that can enhance images, but it must
be used very carefully and with very limited objectives<U+FFFD> There are some
recently published guidelines that are worth keeping in mind.

In particular, you can\'t use Photoshop to delete a band from a blot or
gel, even if you believe that band is an artefact. You can\'t
artificially add duplicate lanes to a blot by using the clone tool. If
you use the contrast and brightness controls to improve the quality of
the image, be sure that your efforts to clean up the image you don\'t
artificially enhance or remove important features.
