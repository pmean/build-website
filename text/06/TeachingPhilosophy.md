The email discussion group, EDSTAT-L, has had an extended discussion of
teaching philosophy. I do some teaching myself, and I must admit that I
don't think nearly enough about my philosophy of teaching. One of the
contributors to EDSTAT-L (JW) cited a textbook, Teaching Engineering, as
a good model to look at (though Statistics and Engineering are quite
different subjects). The full text of this book is online at
