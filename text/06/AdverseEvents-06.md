**[StATS]: Reporting serious adverse events (created
2006-02-03)**.

The FDA held a meeting on March 21, 2005 soliciting opinions about how
adverse events should be reported to Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).

Some of the testimony provided to FDA can be found on the FDA website
and in various spots on the Internet, mostly in PDF format.

This is something I have been interested in, but have not had the time
to work up the details. It seems to me that any system for reporting
adverse events has to have information about the accrual of patients
into the study. Here's a simple graph that shows the entry and exit
times in a research study. It's not exactly a study of adverse events
reports per se, but the example is close enough that I can use to
illustrate the general concepts.

![06_AdverseEvents01.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/images/images/06/AdverseEvents-0601.png)

The accrual rate appears to be more or less constant, though some
patients appear to stay in the study for only a short period of time. In
this example, the treatment being studied is peritoneal dialysis, and
patients can leave the study when they get a kidney transplant or when
they die.

You can get a more accurate picture of the accrual rate by looking at
the date gaps, the number of days between successive recruiting of
patients. So if the first patient is recruited on January 2 and the
second on January 16, the date gap is 14, meaning that you had to wait
two weeks between patients. The date gaps for entry times in this study
are

`  23     0   28   61     7   85   97   45              163   55             120   81   37   94   18 195   10   19 119   31             189   39   32   39   23   36   41 126     1   48    4   41   47 175   27   50   83   95 109   13    4 294     4 124   29 242     4     7   55   28               73   38   10`

The average number of days between recruitment is 64.5 days, which tells
you that a new patient enrolls about every other month. You could detect
whether patient accrual is slowing by looking at the trend in date gaps.

![AdverseEvents02.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/images/images/06/AdverseEvents-0602.png)

An upward trend would imply that recruitment is slowing down, since you
have to wait an increasing amount of time between successive patients.
In this particular example, there is no obvious trend.

Now although it is important to track the rate at which we are accruing
patients, the value of this type of display is far more important when
you look at adverse event reports. The following graph shows rates of
infection for these patients. Each vertical line represents a separate
infection event.

![AdverseEvents03.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/images/images/06/AdverseEvents-0603.png)

There looks to be some evidence that infection rates are slowing down
over the past few years. You can look at the date gaps for this data as
well.

`  40 180 138   98   60   28 365   14   33   14               23   76 144     5   44     4   14   19 136 128               11     6     6   19   39     0   20   59                32     5                38   99 363 573     8 130 109     2`

The first and second infections occurred 40 days apart, and the last two
infections occurred two days apart. A plot of these date gaps is
instructive.

![AdverseEvents04.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/images/images/06/AdverseEvents-0604.png)

Notice several dry spells when we waited a year or more between
successive infection events. Notice also in the middle of the plot where
it seems like new infections were popping up left and right, sometimes
less than a week apart.

The tricky things about these graphs is recognizing what shift and
trends are trivial and which are important. Some variation is to be
expected, but when you see 363 days between infections followed by
another 573 days between infections, you might suspect that something is
going on. The large date gaps early in the process also have a possible
explanation. Patient recruitment started out slowly and only after two
years did the number of patients in the study tend to stabilize (in
other words, the rate at which patients entered the study was matched by
the rate at which patients left the study).

There are other important issues, such as monitoring the rate at which
patients drop out of a study that also lend themselves well to an
approach like this.

I believe that a statistical control chart should be used with data like
this to determine when the process of producing infections (or any
adverse event) has changed. It turns out that the management of these
patients did indeed change in the middle of the study, and there is some
evidence that this led to a lowering of the infection rates.

A statistical control chart would apply well established rules (eight
consecutive points on the same side of the center line, or one point
outside the 3 sigma limits) to determine when the process demands
attention.

I want to examine issues such as the use of log transformations on
charts like these, how best to handle multiple events on a singe day,
and how best to adjust for the varying number of patients being studied,
as well as the tendency for some adverse events to occur more frequently
the longer the patient is under study.
