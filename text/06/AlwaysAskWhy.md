> I have a three year old boy at home and he's learned that one way to

> I'll say "We're going to church this morning" and he'll say
> "Why?" I'll say, "Because it's Sunday" and he'll say "Why?"
> At this point, I'm stumped. Why exactly is it Sunday today and not
> Tuesday.
>
> Or in the morning I'll point out that it's raining outside and
> he'll say "Why?" And I have to struggle with an answer like, "When

> (22\*10). A child weighing 27.5 to 57.5 kg could get a tablet, and

> research trial. Asking why always seems to start a productive dialog.

> > repeatedly that he makes his most valuable contribution simply by
> > persuading the investigator to explain why he wishes to do the
> > experiment, by persuading him to justify the experimental
> > treatments, and to explain why it is that the experiment, when
> > completed, will assist him in his research.*<U+FFFD> \-- Gertrude M. Cox.
