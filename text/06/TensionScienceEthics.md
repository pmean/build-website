**[StATS]:** **The tension between scientific
validity and ethical concerns (created 2006-11-17)**.

> A question on the IRB Forum email discussion group (from RI) centered
> on the ethical concerns about using a placebo arm in a study involving
> control of pain. There are scientific reasons why a placebo control
> group are important, but is it ethical to ask research subjects to
> possibly endure some greater level of pain in order to achieve certain
> scientific goals?
>
> If the amount of pain is minor, I would argue that an IRB's effort to
> protect the research subjects veer towards paternalism. Just make sure
> that the research subjects know what they are in for.
>
> If there is the potential for substantial pain, then things become
> more complicated. There is no consensus in the scientific community
> about placebos, so you can find support for pretty much any position
> from "placebos are never acceptable when an active control is
> available" to "placebo surgery is an acceptable research option."
>
> A good starting point for this debate is the<U+FFFD> International Conference
> on Harmonization (ICH) report E-10 which discusses the use of placebos
> and various alternative designs in great detail. The big advantage of
> knowing ICH E-10 inside and out is that it is an authoritative summary
> of the most permissive perspective on placebos. So if ICH E-10
> doesn't support the use of placebos, nothing will.
>
> It is also important to recognize that there is some tension here
> between the use of a placebo (or scientific validity in a broader
> sense) the desire to avoid undue pain and suffering (ethical concerns
> in a broader sense). A research design<U+FFFD> that is more attractive from
> one perspective is often less attractive from the other perspective.
>
> That's not to say that the two concerns are mutually exclusive. A
> trial that raises ethical concerns with the IRB is likely to raise
> similar concerns with the patients, leading to a subsequent
> degradation of scientific validity when large numbers of patients drop
> out or refuse to join the study in the first place.
>
> On the flip side of the coin, it is unethical to ask patients to
> sacrifice the time, to undergo painful procedures, or to assume a
> greater degree of risk if it is for a trial that has limited
> scientific merit.
>
> So while scientific validity and ethical concerns will often seem to
> be in conflict, you can actually justify scientific validity from an
> ethical perspective and you can justify ethical concerns from a
> scientific validity perspective.
