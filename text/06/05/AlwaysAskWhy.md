**[StATS]:** **Always ask why (May 8, 2006)**

> I have a three year old boy at home and he\'s learned that one way to
> keep the conversation going with an adult is to simply ask the
> question, \"Why?\"
>
> I\'ll say \"We\'re going to church this morning\" and he\'ll say
> \"Why?\" I\'ll say, \"Because it\'s Sunday\" and he\'ll say \"Why?\"
> At this point, I\'m stumped. Why exactly is it Sunday today and not
> Tuesday.
>
> Or in the morning I\'ll point out that it\'s raining outside and
> he\'ll say \"Why?\" And I have to struggle with an answer like, \"When
> there is too much moisture in the air, it falls down to the ground in
> the form of precipitation.\"
>
> At work when people ask me to do something, I need to emulate my
> little boy and and ask them why. Not in a hostile way, but to get them
> to talk some more so I can find out exactly what they want.
>
> Yesterday, someone asked me to compute a standard deviation.
>
> > *Would you be willing to look at this attached chart and give me
> > your advice on how I can calculate the standard deviation of the
> > amount of drug (dose) that a patient may receive due to
> > standardization compared to what is requested, please? For example,
> > if a prescriber wants to order 15 mg/kg of acetaminophen and the
> > dose is standardized. What is the standard deviation from what was
> > ordered on average? Does that make sense?*
>
> She sent me a table showing standardized dosing for acetaminophen. For
> children, the dosage is usually a certain amount per kilogram of body
> weight. But the medicine itself comes in a discrete form, such as
> drops or tablets. The typical dose is 10-15 mg/kg, so a child
> weighting between 12 and 22 kg might get 2ml drops where represents a
> target dose of 200 mg, but at the extremes of the weight range could
> represent a dose as small as 180 (12\*15) or a dose as large as 220
> (22\*10). A child weighing 27.5 to 57.5 kg could get a tablet, and
> this represents a standardized dose of 500 mg, but it could be as
> small as 412.5 or as large as 575. There are 12 rows in the
> spreadsheet just like this.
>
> Now I could probably figure out how to do something that would produce
> a degree of deviation from the norm or standard, but there\'s a very
> good chance that I will produce something that is not quite what this
> person wants. So I wrote back and asked politely why do you need a
> standard deviation? It\'s just a question to get someone to talk more
> about what their goals are.
>
> I try to do this a lot. If they want to match subjects based on age
> and race, I\'ll ask them why they think matching is important. If they
> respond, I thought you had to match or the study wouldn\'t be valid,
> then we can talk about the various ways of ensuring validity of a
> research trial. Asking why always seems to start a productive dialog.
>
> I have a great quote on one of my web pages which is worth repeating
> here because Dr. Cox explains this far better than I could:
>
> > *The statistician who supposes that his main contribution to the
> > planning of an experiment will involve statistical theory, finds
> > repeatedly that he makes his most valuable contribution simply by
> > persuading the investigator to explain why he wishes to do the
> > experiment, by persuading him to justify the experimental
> > treatments, and to explain why it is that the experiment, when
> > completed, will assist him in his research.*Â  \-- Gertrude M. Cox.
