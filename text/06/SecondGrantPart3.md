**[StATS]: My second grant, part 3 (created
2006-10-02)**

I just finished my second grant, which I gave the title "Estimating
delays in completion of IRB approved and KBR supported research
studies" The two acronyms, IRB and KBR should be familiar to the group
I am applying to. IRB stands for Institutional Review Board and KBR
represents an internal grant mechanism here at Children's Mercy
Hospital to support initial research efforts. The initials KBR stand for
[Katherine Berry
Richardson](http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/mowihsp/bios/GrahamRichardson.htm),
who is one of the initial founders in Children's Mercy Hospital.

So I am applying for a KBR grant in order to study delays in completion
of other KBR grants. If nothing else, it should be something that the
KBR grant committee will have an interest in. It will also be
interesting when I request IRB approval for a research study that
reviews IRB approved studies.

The technical abstract for this grant submission is

> *As the research biostatistician at Children's Mercy, Dr. Simon has
> supported the development of literally hundreds of clinical trials
> across just about every branch of pediatric medicine. In his
> experience and in the experience of many of the people he works with,
> the greatest practical problem in conducting medical research is slow
> accrual of patients. It is not unusual to see a research project that
> has gone a full year past its completion date and yet the researcher
> still has less than half of the subjects originally planned for. Slow
> accrual causes serious difficulty for researchers, for groups that
> fund research, and for groups that review research, such as
> Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Data and Safety Monitoring
> Committees.*
>
> *There is little appreciation, however, in the research community for
> the problem caused by slow patient accrual. This lack of concern is
> caused, in large part, by the lack of hard data on scope and magnitude
> of the problem with slow patient accrual. This research proposal asks
> for \$15,000 for a pilot study to evaluate a random sample of 100
> studies approved by the Children's Mercy IRB. This sample will
> produce an estimate of the proportion of studies that fall behind
> schedule, the proportion that end with fewer patients than originally
> planned, and the average shortfall in those studies. A qualitative
> analysis of the interim and final reports will help identify the major
> factors that cause slow patient accrual. The results of this research
> will serve as preliminary data for an R03 or R21 grant to produce
> quantitative tools for planning and monitoring accrual rates in
> clinical trials. These tools will help researchers plan appropriate
> and realistic accrual rates and monitor them regularly, so that
> corrective action can be taken early to get a study back on track.*

and the layperson summary is

> *The greatest practical problem with clinical research studies is the
> inability to recruit patients in sufficient numbers in a limited time
> frame. Although this problem is widely recognized, there is little
> hard data on the extent of this problem. This research study will
> examine the research protocols, interim reports, and final reports of
> a random sample of IRB approved research study to estimate the
> proportion of studies that fall behind schedule and/or fail to recruit
> the originally planned number of patients. This data will help support
> an NIH grant to develop software for better planning and monitoring of
> patient accrual rates in clinical trials.*
