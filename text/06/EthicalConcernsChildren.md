I am giving a talk in London about the differences in research when
children are involved. One major aspect of these differences is that the
ethical and regulatory requirements change. I do not plan to talk about
regulatory issues for two reasons.

First, the regulatory environment is quite diverse. At my hospital,
which straddles the border between the states of Kansas and Missouri, we
have different legal requirements for patients depending on which state
they come from. How much more different is it when you consider
regulations in the international arena!

Second, a focus on just the regulations leads to a narrowly drawn
perspective: what can I get away with. Rather than thinking about your
research from a narrow legalistic perspective, I\'d encourage you to
think about what you are comfortable with. What type of research can you
do and still sleep well at night. The regulatory and legal constraints
are important, of course, because a small number of people have no
conscience and sleep well at night after doing terrible things during
the day. These people cause all the problems for the rest of us.

**Informed consent requirements were derived in response to Nazi medical
experiments**

Ethical research requires the full and free voluntary participation of
your research subjects. This principle was first elaborated in the
Nuremberg code, a set of principles developed in response to abusive
medical experiments conducted by the Nazis at concentration camps and
prisons. There are other abusive medical experiments, such as the
Tuskegee syphilis study, that also raised our awareness of the
importance of informed consent.

There is a nasty tendency in today\'s society to attack research that
you do not like by comparing it to the research done by the Nazis, and I
want to discourage those sorts of analogies. They are not helpful. But
it also important to understand the abuses that led to the first
elaboration of principles of ethical research.

> University Press; 53-59.

It was the Spring of 1944. Eva and her twin sister were at Birkenau. Dr.
Josef Mengele was conducting medical research, and twins were highly
prized for this research. No one told Eva or Miriam what was going on,
what was being done to them or what their ultimate fate would be.

Eva was infected with a germ-she doesn\'t know which one-and developed a
fever. She has put in a hospital, but did not receive any care at all.
Dr. Mengele and a team of doctors reviewed Eva\'s fever chart but did
not otherwise intervene. They gave her no medicine, no food. She had to
crawl by herself to a water faucet to drink.

Eva realized that she would never get out until she convinced these
doctors that she no longer had a fever. She manipulated the thermometers
so that her fever gradually disappeared. After three weeks, she was
re-united with her sister.

> *Upon my return, Miriam told me that during the first 2 weeks of my
> hospitalization, someone had stayed with her continually. She was not
> told of my condition, but it was clear that had I died in the
> hospital, Miriam would have been taken immediately to Mengele\'s lab
> to be killed*

In very cold and cruel terms, Miriam would have been a matched control
subject. Her healthy organs at autopsy would be compared to Eva\'s
disease ravaged organs.

The public\'s response to the horrors of stories like this led to the
development of the Nuremberg Code. The ideas behind the Nuremberg Code
have been refined over time, but it is valuable to read these original
principles. Here are the ten principles.

> *1. The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely
> essential.*
>
> *This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to
> give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free
> power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force,
> fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of
> constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and
> comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to
> enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This
> latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative
> decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him
> the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and
> means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards
> reasonable to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person
> which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.*
>
> *The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the
> consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages
> in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may
> not be delegated to another with impunity*.
>
> *2. The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the
> good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and
> not random and unnecessary in nature.*
>
> *3. The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of
> animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the
> disease or other problem under study, that the anticipated results
> will justify the performance of the experiment.*
>
> *4. The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary
> physical and mental suffering and injury.*
>
> *5. No experiment should be conducted, where there is an a priori
> reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except,
> perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also
> serve as subjects.*
>
> *6. The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined

>
> *7. Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities
> provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote
> possibilities of injury, disability, or death.*
>
> *8. The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically

> required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or
> engage in the experiment.*
>
> *9. During the course of the experiment, the human subject should be

The desire to insure that research participation is truly voluntary has
led to a huge framework for the production and review of the informed
consent process.

There are several notable areas where the need for informed consent can
**SOMETIMES** be waived. It is a bit dangerous to summarize these areas
with just a few bullet points because each of these areas could probably
demand its own three hour training class.

-   Quality assurance programs,
-   Publicly available records,
-   Anonymous patient records,
-   Retrospective chart reviews,
-   Emergency situations where consent is impractical.

The rules are different in the United States and in Europe, but in
general you need to consider the degree of risk in the research and the
practical barriers that obtaining informed consent might raise. The
barriers imposed by obtaining informed consent need to be more than just
an inconvenience to the researcher before you can waive the informed
consent requirement.

There are other areas where informed consent has sometimes been waived.
For example, there have been many studies in which intercessory prayer
has been studied in a double blind randomized trial. In most of these
studies, subjects were not asked for their consent prior to
randomization so as to avoid selection bias.

**Informed consent is impossible in children**

The whole issue of informed consent gets tossed out the window when it
comes to research involving children. Children do not have the maturity
and intellectual capability to make an informed decision to participate.
There is a vigorous debate in the research community about what this
implies, and some have taken the position that non-therapeutic research
(research that does not benefit the patient) is always unethical in
children.

    **(Ethics, Children)**

Among those who believe that non-therapeutic research in children can be
ethical, the conditions under which the research can be considered
ethical center on three carefully defined terms:

-   minimal risk,
-   permission, and
-   assent.

**Minimal risk**. I could not find a European (e.g., EMEA) definition of
minimal risk. The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (45CFR46.102) defines
minimal risk as \"*the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort
anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than
those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of
routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.\"* Note that
there are two dimensions, probability and magnitude. If either dimension
is too large, then the research is not minimal risk. Research is
possible if the risk is greater than minimal risk, but extra safeguards
are needed. The U.S. regulations use some rather convoluted language
here, such as \"minor increase over minimal risk.\"

**Permission**. Most research involving children will obtain permission
from the child\'s parent or legal guardian prior to the research. Just
like informed consent can sometimes be waived, the need for parental
permission can also sometimes be waived. The criteria for waiver examine
the practicality of getting permission as well as the degree of risk.
Sometimes permission is called \"proxy consent\" but you need to be
careful how you use this term.

**Assent**. Although children do not have the intellectual capacity to
provide informed consent, you should still seek their assent before
starting the research. Assent should be an active agreement rather than
a passive failure to raise an objection. When you should seek assent and
the type of assent that you get depends on the age and intellectual
development of the child. There is no hard and fast rule, but many
sources have suggested that children at the age of seven have sufficient
capacity to be able to offer assent. The process of seeking assent, of
course, should be more detailed and involved for a teenager than a seven
year old.  Keep in mind that some pediatric diseases can cause
developmental delays.

A nice review of the issues associated with assent can be found in

-   **A developmental approach to child assent for nontherapeutic
    research.** V. A. Miller, R. M. Nelson. J Pediatr 2006: 149(1
    Suppl); S25-30.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16829238&dopt=Abstract)
    [\[Full
    text\]](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WKR-4KC2H81-7&_coverDate=07%2F31%2F2006&_alid=468623786&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=6913&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000062051&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=4010150&md5=44b53e03ae26b39002ab296cc1fc22b0)
    [\[PDF\]](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6WKR-4KC2H81-7-1&_cdi=6913&_user=4010150&_orig=search&_coverDate=07%2F31%2F2006&_qd=1&_sk=998509998.8998&view=c&_alid=468623786&_rdoc=1&wchp=dGLzVzz-zSkWA&md5=4b5c92e6deaf985ce942ab705f23ea33&ie=/sdarticle.pdf)

Please note that many of the controversies involving minimal risk,
permission, and assent are irrelevant if your pharmacovigilance efforts
involve the use of existing databases. There are indeed privacy risks
for these types of studies, but no need for you to seek permission or
assent, unless you are the one developing the database yourself.

**Financial payments can sometimes undermine informed consent**

When a person volunteers to participate in research, they are offering a
gift to the researchers. They usually suffer some level of
inconvenience. Sometimes they endure painful procedures like
venipuncture. In some cases, they take on additional risk in order to
participate. It seems only natural to offer financial compensation in
return for their sacrifices. But you need to be careful that any
financial payment does not become so large as to become an undue
influence. This influence could lead people to discount the risks of the
research and to hide potential disqualifying information from the
researchers. To better understand the controversies behind these issues,
you should recognize the distinctions among four different types of
financial payments:

1.  **Reimbursement** payments, which cover direct expenditures such as
    transportation costs and time lost from work,
2.  **Compensation** payments, which cover indirect expenses such as the
    inconvenience of not being able to sleep late on a Saturday morning,
3.  **Appreciation** payments, which represent an effort to offer thanks
    to the research participants.
4.  **Incentive** payments, which represent an effort to encourage
    enrollment in the research study.

Financial compensation in a pediatric study is controversial and there
are those who argue that ANY payments in a pediatric research study are
unethical. In children, there are two problems. First, even a small
amount of money may seem large to a child and cloud their judgment. For
some children, the amount of money they receive in exchange for
participating in a research study might be more money at one time than
they have ever had before. Second, money that is given to the parent may
potentially encourage the parent to exploit their children. Very few
parents would do something that would benefit them at the expense of
their children. Indeed, almost every parent will make significant
sacrifices on behalf of their children and would be horrified at even
the thought of doing anything against the interests of their children.
Sadly, though, there are enough parents who don\'t have their
children\'s best interests at heart that you need to be careful.

Discussion of what level is appropriate for these four types of payments
appears in an Institute of Medicine report, Ethical Conduct of Research
Involving Children (available at
[www.nap.edu/catalog/10958.html](http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10958.html))
and is summarized in

-   **Appropriate compensation of pediatric research participants:
    thoughts from an Institute of Medicine committee report.** B. W.
    Ramsey. J Pediatr 2006: 149(1 Suppl); S15-9.

Incentive payments raise the most concerns and the committee strongly
discouraged their use. Incentives intended to overcome recruitment
problems for painful and risky procedures are especially to be avoided.
Appreciation payments are acceptable if they are \"age-appropriate and
of nominal monetary value.\"

There is little controversy, according to the IOM report, on
reimbursement payments or compensation payments, as long as they are not
unrealistically large. You can offer to buy someone lunch, but not lunch
at a five star restaurant, for example. Defining what is unrealistic for
indirect expenses is tricky and depends a lot on the economic
circumstances of the child and parents. Bonnie Ramsey, the author of the
above article shares two interesting anecdotes.

The first described a teenager who visited a clinic with multiple
research studies open for volunteers who announced \"Tell me all the
studies going on and exactly how much each pays!\" Clearly there is a
problem with undue financial influence in this situation.

The second involved a discussion of a particular research project
between Dr. Ramsey and a teenager with Cystic Fibrosis as well as that
teenager\'s parents.

Dr. Ramsey makes an important point here, that compensation to remove
barriers is certainly reasonable and goes on to suggest that other
things beyond money (such as scheduling appointments at times convenient
to the family rather than at times convenient to the researcher) might
be worth considering.

Another important issue is the timing and distribution of payments in a
longitudinal study. Certain studies have an increasing scale of
compensation over time that reflects the real value of getting full
information across the time spectrum on as many patients as possible.
This can include a \"balloon payment\" at the end of the study, a large
sum paid only to patients that complete all of the required visits. In
general, the use of an increasing scale or a balloon payment is not
consistent with reimbursement or compensation. These payments can
sometimes be coercive, because a patient may be reluctant to withdraw
from the study early when faced with the loss of a substantial portion
of the financial compensation.

Again it is worth noting with data collected by someone else (a frequent
source of information in pharmacovigilance trials) that you do not have
to worry about any compensation issues.
