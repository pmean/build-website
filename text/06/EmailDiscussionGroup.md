**[StATS]:** **Email discussion groups (September
13, 2006)**

An email discussion group is a collection of individuals with a common
interest who supply their email address to a common site, typically
called a listserver. When individuals in that group have questions or
comments on a topic of interest, they send an email to the listserver
and a copy of that message is sent to everyone in the group.

I learn a lot from various email discussion groups. Here are a few that
I like:

-   [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/docs/mailList.html)
    \"This mailing list is for announcements about the development of
    Bioconductor and the availability of new code, questions and answers
    about problems and solutions using Bioconductor, enhancements and
    patches to the source code and documentation of Bioconductor, as
    well as general discussions on topics of interest to the
    Bioconductor community.\"
-   [BUGS](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/archives/bugs.html) \"This
    moderated list has been set up as forum for sharing ideas and asking
    questions about modelling issues using BUGS. It is NOT intended for
    problems with crashes, error messages, or \`my program won\'t
    work\'!\"
-   [Edstat-l](http://lists.psu.edu/archives/edstat-l.html) There is no
    description at this site, but edstat-l focuses on statistical
    education.
-   [Epidemio-l](http://www.listes.umontreal.ca/wws/info/epidemio-l)
    \"The discussion of this group focuses on methodological issues that
    are relevant to epidemiology (classical and otherwise). These are
    methodological issues that are relevant to population studies which
    address health problems and questions. The discussions are therefore
    not restricted to approaches and procedures relevant to studying
    determinants of health/illness and outcome of interventions, but
    include approaches relevant to the organization of the health care
    delivery system.\"
-   [Evidence-Based
    Health](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/EVIDENCE-BASED-HEALTH.html)
    There is no description at this site, but another site describes
    this as \"an electronic discussion forum and information resource
    for people working in and teaching evidence-based health care and
    its application in health related fields, primarily in the academic
    community.\"
-   [IRB Forum](http://www.irbforum.org/) \"The IRB Forum (previously
    known as \"MCWIRB\") promotes the discussion of ethical, regulatory
    and policy concerns with human subjects research.\"
-   [MedStats](http://groups.google.com/group/MedStats) \"A discussion
    group for anyone with an interest in Medical Statistics.\"
-   [SPSS](http://listserv.uga.edu/archives/spssx-l.html) There is no
    description at this site, but this list covers issues with the use
    of SPSS software.

(Postscript: September 26, 2006) The American Statistical Association
has number of email discussion groups of interest to statisticians. The
page that lists these groups is at
