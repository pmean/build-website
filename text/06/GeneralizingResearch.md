> This study reviewed the literature for mental health interventions for
> chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic pack
> pain. The authors distinguished between care given in a primary care
> and secondary care location. There was little research about primary
> car interventions and these studies had the following methodological
> limitations
>
> -   *Inadequate information about the content and quality of the
>     intervention and the comparison group*
> -   *Lack of data on characteristics of the patient sample*
> -   *Limited assessment of outcome: short term only, no cost
>     effectiveness data*
> -   *Studies commonly not powerful enough to detect clinically
>     important differences with high precision.*
> -   *Great diversity of measurement instruments used*
> -   *Problems of internal validity*
>
> Still, the authors were able to draw some conclusions, and the
> research conducted in primary care settings seemed to have more modest
> effects than research conducted in a secondary care setting. The
> authors offered several explanations for this:
>
> > *We identified four factors that may contribute to the greater
> > improvements seen in secondary care than primary care. The first
> > factor relates to differences between patients in the two settings.
> > Patients in secondary care were more severely ill than their primary
> > care counterparts (for cognitive behaviour therapy and behaviour
> > therapy in back pain). Other unaccounted patient differences may
> > explain the greater improvement in secondary care than primary care
> > for patients with irritable bowel syndrome taking antidepressants.
> > The second factor concerns differences in the treatment regimen. In
> > the two studies of antidepressants in irritable bowel syndrome for
> > which we could compare treatment effect sizes, the minimum
> > therapeutic dose was used in the primary care study, whereas a dose
> > exceeding the recommended maximum dose was used in the secondary
> > care study. Similarly, primary care patients with chronic fatigue
> > syndrome received just four hours of cognitive behaviour therapy
> > whereas secondary care patients received 16 hours of treatment. The
> > third factor concerns differences in treatment provision: for
> > cognitive behaviour therapy in irritable bowel syndrome, studies
> > that reported an improvement used fewer therapists, most of whom
> > were supervised by doctors, than studies that found no effect. The
> > final factor is concerned with differences in study design. In the
> > studies of behaviour therapy for back pain, the control group in the
> > secondary care setting was assigned to the waiting list, whereas in
> > the primary care study they were provided with an educational
> > package that could be regarded as an active treatment.*

> So if you practice in a primary care setting and rely on research
> conducted in a secondary care setting, you may be overestimating the
> treatment effect that you will see with your patients.
