manner. Here are the first five articles in the series:

The abstract of the first article explains the genesis of this review:

> *In 2005 the World Health Organisation (WHO) asked its Advisory
> Committee on Health Research (ACHR) for advice on ways in which WHO
> can improve the use of research evidence in the development of
> recommendations, including guidelines and policies. The ACHR
> established the Subcommittee on the Use of Research Evidence (SURE) to
> collect background documentation and consult widely among WHO staff,
> international experts and end users of WHO recommendations to inform
> its advice to WHO. We have prepared a series of reviews of methods
> that are used in the development of guidelines as part of this
> background documentation. We describe here the background and methods
> of these reviews, which are being published in Health Research Policy
> and Systems together with this introduction.*
