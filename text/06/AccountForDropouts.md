I helped out a colleague with an NIH grant, and when the critique came
back, it mentioned two issues that I should have been aware of. First,
they pointed out the need for an intention-to-treat analysis strategy.
Second, they noted the long duration of the study, with a full year of
evaluations on any particular patient, and seemed bothered that we
presumed that 100% of the patients would complete the full study. This
is indeed naive on my part, and the calculation of a revised sample size
is quite simple. If you believe that a proportion P less than 1 of the
patients will complete the study, take your sample size from the power
calculation and divide by P to get a revised sample size that allows for
dropouts.

For example, if your sample size calculation indicates that a total of
40 patients are needed, and you expect only 80% of your patients will
complete the full study, then plan to enroll 40 / 0.8 = 50 patients.
