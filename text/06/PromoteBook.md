**[StATS]: Using a web site to promote your book
(May 10, 2006)**

> Someone on the [MedStats](../category/InterestingWebsites.html#MeStXx)
> email discussion group asked about how you use a web page to provide
> things like
>
> > *supplemental chapters, expanded tables of critical values, practice
> > tests, case studies etc.*
>
> Gee, what a coincidence. That's what I am hoping to do at my [Stats:
> Statistical Evidence in Medical Trials](../evidence.asp) web page.
>
> I said that<U+FFFD> my employer has generously provided me with space for a
> web site, and you should check with your employer also. A subweb at
> your employers web site will carry some restrictions, and some
> employers might impose only some trivial restrictions (e.g., no links
> to pornographic sites) or they may be excessively restrictive (e.g.,
> no commentary about anything remotely controversial). I've only had
> one time when the powers that be asked me to change something on my
> web site, and that suggestion was actually perfectly reasonable. Some
> places would want to tinker with your web pages to insure that certain
> corporate style standards are followed. Be sure you know what you are
> getting into. In addition, see if your publisher can offer space at
> their web site.
>
> I also made some general recommendations about commercial vendors:
>
> 1\. Do not try to save some money by allowing ads on your web site. That
> would be counterproductive in the long run. Ads make you look
> unprofessional and will keep some visitors from regularly visiting and
> bookmarking your site. I include a lot of links on my web pages, but I
> think long and hard before I link to a site that has any advertising.
>
> 2\. Choose a host that allows you to use your own domain name. You will
> get more visitors if your main page is www.mybook.com rather than
> www.myhost.com/mybook. Choose a name that is reasonably short and easy
> to spell, especially when you are talking to someone over the phone.
> Avoid special symbols if you can. Sadly, my employer switched from a
> nice easy name, www.cmh.edu, to something more difficult,
> www.childrens-mercy.org. I understand why they did it, but I find the
> former name to be much easier to give to someone in casual conversation.
>
> 3\. Estimate the size of your web site in advance, and think about little
> things like search capabilities, ability to create a blog, automatic
> submission of your site to major search engines, creation of special
> email accounts, simplified web templates, etc. that you may or may not
> want. Decide all of this in advance, as it will influence how much you
> will have to pay.
>
> 4\. Don't use pop-up windows, frames, or animation on your web pages.
