> **What are artificial neural networks and what they can do?** V.
> Dohnal, K. Kuca, D. Jun. Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech
> Repub 2005: 149(2); 221-4.

> *The artificial neural networks (ANN) are very often applied in many
> areas of toxicology for the solving of complex problems, such as the
> prediction of chemical compound properties and quantitative
> structure-activity relationship. The aim of this contribution is to
> give the basic knowledge about conception of ANN, theirs division and
> finally, the typical application of ANN will be discussed. Due to the
> diversity of architectures and adaptation algorithms, the ANNs are
> used in the broad spectrum of applications from the environmental
> processes modeling, through the optimization to quantitative
> structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods. In addition,
> especially ANNs 32with Kohonen learning are very effective
> classification tool. The ANNs are mostly applied in cases, where the
> commonly used methods does not work.*

> [\[PDF\]](http://www.medscimonit.com/pub/vol_4/no_3/694.pdf) *The main
> aim of research in medical diagnostics is to develop more exact,
> cost-effective and easy-to-use systems, procedures and methods for
> supporting clinicians. In this paper the authors introduce a new
> method that recently came into the focus referred to as computer
> generated neural networks. Based on the literature of the past 5-6
> years they give a brief review - highlighting the most important
> articles - showing the idea behind neural networks and where they are
> used in the medical field. The definition, structure and operation of
> neural networks are discussed. In the application section they discuss
> examples in order to give an insight into neural network application
> research. It is emphasized that in the near future completely new
> diagnostic equipment can be developed based on this new technology in
> the field of ECG, EEG and macroscopic and microscopic image analysis
> systems.*
