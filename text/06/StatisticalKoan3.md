> **The blindfolded donkey.**
>
> Student Leaf approached Master Stem with a question. "*Master Stem.
> My statistical model requires an assumption of normality, but I have
> an outlier in the data. Should I not remove the outlier so I can
> satisfy this assumption?*"
>
> Master Stem replied, "*It is a perilous journey you are undertaking
> and I understand your caution. When I last crossed the mountains, I
> was also cautious. The donkey I rode upon knew the path well, but
> during the most dangerous part of the journey, I blindfolded him
> because if he could not see the loose rocks on the path, he would not
> slip on them.*"
