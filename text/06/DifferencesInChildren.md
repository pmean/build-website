A recently published report from the Institute of Medicine, Emergency
Care for Children\--Growing Pains, has a very nice table in the
introduction that highlights some of the differences between children
and adults. This material is very helpful for a talk I am preparing, so
I have adapted this material and placed it below.

The report first highlighted anatomical differences between children and
adults.

  **Anatomical Differences**                                                                                                                                                                                                  **Implications for Illness\                                                                                                                                          **Implications for Care**
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              and Injury**                                                                                                                                                         

  Greater body to surface area to body mass ratio.                                                                                                                                                                            Greater risk of excessive loss of heat and fluids; children are affected by more quickly and easily toxins that are absorbed through the skin.                       Increased body surface area makes children more susceptible to greater heat loss when they are exposed during resuscitation; the higher percentage of body surface area devoted to the head relative to the lower extremities must be taken into account when determining the percentage of body surface area involved in burn injuries.

  Smaller airways; tongue is large relative to the oropharynx; larynx is higher and more anterior in the neck; vocal cords are at a more anterocaudal angle; epiglottis is soft and shaped differently from that in adults.   A right main stem intubation can lead to iatrogenic complications; more susceptible to respiratory distress due to airway swelling from infection or inflammation.   Special equipment and training are needed for intubation; appropriately sized endotracheal intubation tubes, stylettes, and laryngoscope blades are necessary. A childs airway is more difficult to maintain and intubate. Children are at higher risk for a right mainstem bronchus intubation.

  Less protective muscle around internal organs.                                                                                                                                                                              Internal organs are more susceptible to traumatic forces.                                                                                                            Recognition of internal injury requires a high degree of suspicion, and such injury should not be ruled out based on the absence of external signs of trauma.

  Small size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 More vulnerable to exposure and toxicity from agents that are heavier than air, such as sarin gas and chlorine, and that accumulate closer to the ground.            <U+FFFD>

  Less fat, less elastic connective tissue, and closer proximity of chest and abdominal organs.                                                                                                                               Higher frequency of multiple organ injury.                                                                                                                           <U+FFFD>

  Head is proportionally larger and heavier in children.                                                                                                                                                                      Head injury is common in young children.                                                                                                                             Head size also makes children more susceptible to greater heat loss when they are exposed during resuscitation.

  More pliable skeleton; thoracic cage of a child does not provide as much protection of organs as that of adults.                                                                                                            More susceptible to fracture and other injuries from blunt trauma.                                                                                                   Orthopedic injuries with subtle symptoms are easily missed; hepatic or splenic injuries can go unrecognized and produce significant blood loss, leading to shock.

The report also described physiological differences.

  -------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Physiological Differences**                **Implications for Illness\                                                                                             **Implications for Care**
                                               and Injury**                                                                                                            

  Respiratory and heart rates vary with age.   More susceptible to air\                                                                                                Knowledge of normal and abnormal rates based on age is required; normal vital signs differ for children and adults. An increased heart rate is often the first sign of shock in a pediatric patient, versus blood pressure in an adult. Children maintain heart rate during the early phases of hypovolemic shock, creating a false impression of normalcy.
                                               pollutants.                                                                                                             

  Higher metabolic rates.                      More susceptible to contaminants in food or water; greater risk for increased loss of water and when ill or stressed.   Medication doses must\
                                                                                                                                                                       be carefully calculated\
                                                                                                                                                                       based on the childs\
                                                                                                                                                                       weight and body size.\
                                                                                                                                                                       <U+FFFD>

  Lower blood pressure\                        Indicators of serious illness may not appear until the child is near collapse.                                          Vital signs are less reliable indicators of serious illness than in adults. Respiratory arrest is more common than cardiac arrest; cardiopulmonary arrest is signaled by respiratory arrest or shock, rather than by\
  levels than adults; levels\                                                                                                                                          cardiac arrhythmias.
  vary with age.                                                                                                                                                       

  Immature immunological systems.              Greater risk of infection; less herd immunity from infections such as smallpox.                                         <U+FFFD>
  -------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are also important developmental differences between children and
adults.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Developmental Differences**                                                                                                                                              **Implications for Illness\   **Implications for Care**
                                                                                                                                                                             and Injury**                  

  Communication barriers may exist in all pediatric age groups, but the nature of the barrier varies by age (i.e., infants and young children cannot articulate symptoms).   <U+FFFD>                             Assessment tools need to be tailored to reflect age-appropriate responses.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, there are emotional differences.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Emotional Differences**                                        **Implications for Illness\                                                                                                                                      **Implications for Care**
                                                                   and Injury**                                                                                                                                                     

  Greater, varying emotional needs based on developmental level.   <U+FFFD>                                                                                                                                                                Need for family-centered policies and a family-friendly environment in EDs. Depending on age, children require or prefer the presence of a parent during treatment.

  Higher sensitivity to environmental factors during treatment.    Age and developmental level of child, characteristics of event, and parental reactions play significant role in determining the childs reactions and recovery.   Providers must manage the mental health needs of pediatric patients and parents reactions.

Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Paediatric Population. This
report covers a wide range of issues but has an especially nice section
covering the challenges of research involving pre-term infants.

Many of these issues also apply to full term infants less than 30 days
of age.

Some informal comments I have received in conversations with some of the
doctors here have also been eye-opening. The brain develops rapidly
during the first year of life and anything that interferes with this
process can cause serious developmental delays. For an adult, it's
different\--if we kill a few million brain cells by drinking a pint of
Stout, that's not such a bad thing.

Coagulation factors require higher doses in children, which has
implications for the treatment of conditions like hemophilia.

Drugs that cause retention of water have a disproportionate impact on
children because of their smaller size, and seizures from hyponatremia
are a serious concern.

Many of the diseases in adults are caused (or at least exacerbated by)
years of abuse and neglect (too much food, too little exercise, too many
cigarettes). Children do not have enough years in their lives yet and
they don't start many of these abusive and neglectful habits until they
are well on their way into adulthood. As a result, most of the
conditions that we treat children for stem from congenital causes rather
than from abuse and neglect.
