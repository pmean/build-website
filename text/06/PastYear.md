**[StATS]:** **The past year in my weblog (January
4, 2006)**. [Category: Website details](../category/WebsiteDetails.html)

> I just cleaned up the weblog and put all the old entries in separate
> files in the archive. It was a busy year (though I did slow down a lot
> in November and December). There were 197 weblog entries in 2005.
> I\'ll try to keep up the pace in 2006 and investigates things like an
> RSS feed (as was suggested by one of my readers).
