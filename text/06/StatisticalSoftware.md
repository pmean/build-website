The January 2006 issue of Amstat News had the following announcement:

> *The Journal of Statistical Software is now an official ASA journal.
> Published by UCLA Statistics since 1996, the editorial board and the
> website will remain as they now are, and UCLA Statistics will continue
> to host and manage the journal. Access will remain free for both
> articles and software.*

You can access JSS at [www.jstatsoft.org](http://www.jstatsoft.org), and
this journal has full free text of all articles in PDF format. Here are
two interesting articles from recent issues.

    Computing.** Baiocchi G. Journal of Statistical Software 2004:
