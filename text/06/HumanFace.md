A correspondent (BD) on the Evidence Based Health email discussion group
pointed out the following web site:

-   [www.uwec.edu/lgibbs/index.htm](http://www.uwec.edu/lgibbs/index.htm)

The author of this website, Len Gibbs, is a prominent expert in Evidence
Based Medicine. He was recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of
prostate cancer. He has some advice about how patients like him should
proactively research information about medicine that is relevant to
their own lives. I've only read a bit of this so far, but it is both
very compelling and very instructive.
