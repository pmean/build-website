**[StATS]:** **Cherry picking the literature
(December 20, 2006)**

I have a relative who loves to send me articles supporting a particular
religious and political viewpoint that he endorses. While that viewpoint
he espouses is usually conservative, the problems with the articles he
cites are problems that plague both sides. These articles always have an
impressive bibliography, as if to say "Look! It was published and
peer-reviewed, so it must be true." The problem with these articles
though is that the bibliography was created using a process called
"cherry picking."

Cherry picking is selecting those articles that support your viewpoint
and ignoring the ones that do not support your viewpoint. How can you
tell when someone is cherry picking the literature?

I dislike examining motives because it is subjective, but before you do
any evaluation, at least make a cursory attempt to discern the
prevailing political or religious viewpoint of the author. It happens
most often with people who have a strong motivation to demonstrate a
particular outcome. Strongly motivated people are still capable of
producing objective findings, but **the tendency to be selective seems
to be associated with extreme viewpoints**. The more extreme the
political or religious persuasion of the author, the more important it
is for you to look for evidence of objectivity as described below.

Second, look for evidence of a **systematic effort to identify ALL of
the relevant research**. There are various publicly available tools like
PubMed that allow you to "google" the peer-reviewed literature. Beware
if the author fails to explain the process of article selection.

Third, look for an **objective discussion of the strengths and
weaknesses of each article found**. Beware if the author reserves
his/her criticisms only for contradictory research, and fails to note
the weaknesses that are present in the supportive studies.

Finally, beware of anyone who **accepts all research findings
uncritically** or someone who **nitpicks to excess**. The truth is
somewhere in the middle. All research has flaws and limitations, but
much of the research is still informative in spite of these flaws. The
latter flaw, nitpicking, is the more common one. Someone who is
motivated to discredit the entire research enterprise is usually up to
serious mischief.

So don't be fooled by an impressive bibliography. The process that was
used to create that bibliography is important.
