**[StATS]:** **Statistical koans (February 27,
2006)**

> **Update: Check out my [koan page](../koans.asp).**
>
> I've been thinking about using a literacy device known as a
> [koan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koan) to illustrate important
> statistical issues. A koan is a story used in Buddhist teaching that
> involves a seemingly meaningless or contradictory statement. Careful
> contemplation of this statement leads you to a more fuller
> understanding of Buddhist teaching. Often these stories end with a
> student reaching a state of greater enlightenment, so might be related
> to the concept of experiencing an
> [epiphany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_(feeling)). Here's
> an example:
>
> > *Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era (1868-1912),
> > received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen.
> > Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor's cup full, and then kept
> > on pouring. The professor watched the overflow until he no longer
> > could restrain himself. "It is overfull. No more will go in!"
> > "Like this cup," Nan-in said, "you are full of your own opinions
> > and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your
> > cup?"* as quoted on the Zen Koans page,
> > [www.ashidakim.com/zenkoans/1acupoftea.html](http://www.ashidakim.com/zenkoans/1acupoftea.html)
>
> Although koans have an overt link to religion, they have been used by
> others to illustrate difficult non-religious issues.
>
> > *In the days when Sussman was a novice Minsky once came to him as he
> > sat hacking at the PDP-6. "What are you doing?", asked Minsky. "I
> > am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-Tac-Toe." "Why
> > is the net wired randomly?", asked Minsky. "I do not want it to
> > have any preconceptions of how to play." Minsky shut his eyes.
> > "Why do you close your eyes?", Sussman asked his teacher. "So the
> > room will be empty." At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.* as
> > quoted on the Artificial Intelligence Koans page,
> > [www.serve.com/cmtan/buddhism/Lighter/aikoans.html](http://www.serve.com/cmtan/buddhism/Lighter/aikoans.html)
>
> Some other examples of non-religious koans appear at [The Rootless
> Root, the Unix Koans of Master Foo, by Eric Steven
> Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/unix-koans/).
>
> Could I use the same device to teach Statistics? Probably not, but
> I'll try anyway. So here is the first ever statistical koan:
>
> > Master Stem was teaching the class about the perils of observational
> > data when Student Leaf interrupted. "*Master Leaf,*" the student
> > inquired, "*You have taught us that randomized studies are the only
> > true path to knowledge. So why do you now teach us about
> > observational studies?*"
> >
> > Master Stem replied, "*Have I been so certain about the true
> > validity of research that uses randomization?*"
> >
> > Student Leaf replied, "*Yes, Master Stem. You taught us that
> > randomized studies assure us of a fair and unbiased comparison that
> > cannot be achieved without randomization. By invoking the law of
> > large numbers, you have shown that only randomized studies prevent
> > bias from unknown and unmeasured covariates.*"
> >
> > Then Master Stem replied, "*Very good, Student Leaf. And this
> > knowledge about the superiority of randomized studies, did it itself
> > emerge from a randomized study?*"
>
> If I get inspired I may write a few more statistical koans. What I am
> hoping is to find a good koan that illustrates the logical flaws of
> traditional hypothesis testing. If I am successful it will lead to my
> first Bayesian epiphany.
