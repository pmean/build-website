A regular contributor to EDSTAT-L (KW) asked about how to handle a bad
peer review of an article that a colleague had submitted. The reviewer
appeared to get the definitions of positive and negative skewness
backwards.

That's a point where I encourage people to be charitable. Why not
assume that the reviewer just got momentarily confused about positive
and negative skewness. I still get my left foot and right foot confused
during dance lessons.

The reviewer also suggested that analysis of transformed data was a
"data manipulation trick" and requested that the analysis be done on
the original untransformed data.

If a reviewer suggests a minor change in the data analysis, and that's
all it takes to get the paper published, I generally encourage people to
give in on this point. Arguing over a minor point isn't worth it in the
long run. Unless you have a really strong reason to keep the analysis
unchanged, re-run the analysis on the untransformed data. It won't take
more than a few minutes and it virtually guarantees publication.

This reviewer did use rather harsh language and it a bit of a
nit-picker, so it's hard not to react defensively. But I think the
wisest course is to save your ammunition for the truly important
battles. When a reviewer says "I don't like how you analyzed the
data" I try to be grateful that they didn't say "This data is so
awful that no data analysis could salvage it."
