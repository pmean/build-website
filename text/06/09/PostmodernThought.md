> and others define in a way so that it represents everything that is
> bad. I like the Wikipedia for its efforts to present controversial

> thinkers would argue is not possible). The web page on postmodernism:
>
> -   [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism)

> offers a range of definitions, three of which I believe are relevant
> to EBM. First postmodernism is
>
> > *A continual skepticism towards the ideas and ideals of the modern
> > era, especially the ideas of progress, objectivity, reason,
> > certainty & personal identity, and grand narrative in general*
>
> This definition places postmodernism in conflict with EBM, which often
> cites examples of medical progress through the careful application of
> medical research. For example, we have learned that folate
> supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube
> defects through the use of several randomized trials.
>
> Postmodernism and EBM also conflict over the concept of objectivity.
> EBM promotes objectivity through the use of grading scales, user
> guides to the literature, systematic overviews, and so forth.
>
> Two other definitions on the Wikipedia page represent skepticism about
> objectivity.
>
> Postmodernism can be defined as
>
> > *The belief that all communication is shaped by cultural bias, myth,
> > metaphor, and political content.*
>
> Or as
>
> > *The assertion that meaning and experience can only be created by
> > the individual, and cannot be made objective by an author or
> > narrator.*
>
> Perhaps the most popular exposition of a postmodern philosophy is the
> claim in Dan Brown\'s DaVinci Code that \"history is written by the
> winners.\" It is actually through an analogy of historical thought
> that the concept of postmodernism became clearer to me.
>
> Can historians reach an objective conclusion about something like the
> existence of the Holocaust? That\'s a topic tackled early in a book by
> Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman, \"Denying History: Who Says the
> Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?\" The book reviews
> the evolution of historical thought which started as a belief that an
> objective account of history was an achievable goal. It then evolved
> into a postmodern belief that all historical accounts reflect the
> viewpoint of the historian. Note the quote on the Wikipedia page on
> history
>
> > *In recent years, postmodernists have challenged the validity and
> > need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based
> > on the personal interpretation of sources.*
> > [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History)
>
> The most recent perspective on history, according to Shermer and
> Grobman, is that personal interpretations do influence historical
> accounts to some extent and some historical facts will always remain
> in dispute. But historians can indeed arrive at objective
> conclusions.\

> *We prove the Holocaust through a convergence of data that include:*
>
> -   ***Written documents**-letters, memos, blueprints of the camps,
>     orders, bills, speeches, articles, memoirs and confessions.*
> -   ***Eyewitness testimony accounts** from survivors, members of the
>     Jewish sonderkomandos who took bodies out of the gas chambers, SS
>     guards, commandants, local townspeople and high-ranking nazi
>     officials. We have many letters from German soldiers stationed on
>     the Russian front to their families in, which they describe the
>     mass shooting of Jews.*
> -   ***Photographs**-including official military and press
>     photographs, civilian photographs, secret photographs taken by
>     survivors, aerial photographs, German and allied film footage and
>     photographs taken by the German military.*
> -   ***The camps themselves**;*

> The Shermer and Grobman argument shows the folly of a total embrace of
> postmodern thought. If you believe that there is no possibility of an
> objective account of history, then you have to accept the possibility
> that the Holocaust was a creation of a Jewish conspiracy. So a total
> embrace of postmodern philosophy would leave us open to any crackpot
> theory that might come along.

> On the other hand, a wholesale rejection of postmodern philosophy
> would lead to problems as well. When journal editors require
> disclaimers about financial conflicts of interest, it is done with the
> understanding that readers will interpret the data differently when
> they realize the source of the data. That sounds kind of postmodern to
> me.
>
> Joel Best, in his book, Damned Lies and Statistics, has a very nice
> argument for postmodernism when he states:
>
> > \"We sometimes talk about statistics as though they are facts that
> > simply exist, like rocks, completely independent of people, and that
> > people gather statistics much as rock collectors pick up stones.
> > This is wrong. All statistics are created through people\'s action:
> > people have to decide what to count and how to count it, people have
> > to do the counting, and people have to interpret the resulting
> > statistics, to decide what the numbers mean. All statistics are
> > social products, the results of people\'s efforts.\"
>
> This is not to say that all statistics are bad, just that you can\'t
> interpret them without first understanding the context in which they
> were created.
>
> The same can be argued about EBM. Medical research is produced in a
> social context, and failure to recognize this is a serious limitation
> of EBM. Not to pick on a single medical specialty, but when someone
> argues \"they\'re only saying this because they\'re surgeons\" that is
> probably a good thing as long as you don\'t take it to the point of
> \"you can\'t trust anything that a surgeon tells you.\"
>
> I suspect (but have to admit that this is just speculation) that the
> authors of \"Deconstructing the evidence-based discourse in health
> sciences: truth, power and fascism\" have adopted a postmodern
> position because they are upset at the EBM rejection of some forms of
> alternative medicine. Indeed there are some in the alternative
> medicine community who adopt an evidentiary perspective that places
> individual patient narratives above randomized trials. Many
> alternative medicine websites offer wholesale criticisms of the
> medical research enterprise and offer anecdotal evidence in its place.
>
> This antipathy is reflected from the opposite perspective by the
> comments of Angell and Kassirer in a famous NEJM editorial
>
> > *There cannot be two kinds of medicine - conventional and
> > alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested
> > and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may
> > or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no
> > longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset.

> There are, however, just as many proponents of alternative medicine
> who have embraced EBM and believe that when the proper research
> studies are done, they will support alternative medicine as superior
> to traditional Western medicine. There are also advocates of EBM who
> admit that the randomized control trial is not the ideal arbitrator of
> truth when evaluating alternative medicine.
