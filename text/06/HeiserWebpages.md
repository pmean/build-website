**[StATS]:** **Technical Articles and Reports by
David Heiser (November 7, 2006)** [Category: Websites](../category/Websites.asp)

> David A. Heiser, a regular contributor to EDSTAT-L, has a nice web
> page at that covers some of the numerical accuracy and computational
> problems inherent in many statistical functions in Microsoft Excel. He
> also lists a series of tests that you can apply to these functions to
> evaluate their performance. Another section of Dr. Heiser\'s web page
> includes a list of the various measures of skewness and kurtosis. I
> only skimmed these resources, but they look quite good.
