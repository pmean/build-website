**[StATS]:** **You won\'t have Steve Simon to kick
around anymore (May 24, 2006)**

The results of the election of officers for the American Statistical
Association came out today, and sad to say, I came in second in a two
person race. I was running for Vice Chair of District 4, Region 2, of
the Council of Chapters. The winner, Kathy Morrisey from Strategy 2
Market, Inc., had very good credentials, so I don\'t feel too bad about
this.
