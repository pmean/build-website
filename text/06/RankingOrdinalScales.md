**[StATS]: The problem with ranking ordinal scales
(June 29, 2006)**

When I was young and naive, I thought that anytime you encountered
ordinal data, it would make the most sense to use a test statistic based
on ranks, such as the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test or the Kruskal-Wallis
test. Unfortunately, the ranks can sometime distort the true nature of
an ordinal scale.

I thought that I had provided an example of how ranks can distort
things, but I could not find it this morning when someone asked a
question relating to ordinal scales. So here is the example again.

Suppose we ask in a survey about people's income, but the question is
asked in an ordinal fashion. For example:

What is your family's gross annual income?
a. 0-5,000 dollars
b. 5,000-20,000 dollars
c. 20,000-50,000 dollars
d. 50,000-100,000 dollars
e.100,000-250,000 dollars
f. more than 250,000 dollars

You get 50 responses and they are summarized below

Now what happens if you try to rank this data? The 11 people in the
lowest category would have ranks 1-11. The commonly used approach would
be to assign each of these 11 people a rank of 6, which represents the
average of the ranks 1-11. Similarly the second category has ranks
12-24, and we assign an average rank of 18 to this group.

The table below shows the average rank computed for each of the 6 income
categories.

Notice that there is a relatively small shift in the average rank when
you move from 50-100K to 100-250K. A shift of approximately 100,000
(subtracting the midpoints of these two categories) corresponds to a
shift of only 6 units in the average rank. In contrast, a shift from
10-20K to 20-50K, a shift of approximately 20,000 has a shift of 12
units in the average rank.

So the net effect of this rank transformation is to make small changes
in income seem relatively large and to make large changes in income seem
relatively small.

There may be some particular applications where you do indeed want to
put greater emphasis on changes in the lower income categories. For
example, sometimes a small shift in income among relatively poor
families has a larger impact than a large change among relatively rich
families.

It's perfectly fine if you make such a conscious decision to
overemphasize small changes in income among relatively poor families.
The problem is that the rank transformation will distort the scale
without any active intervention or thought by you the researcher. The
distortion will be based not on any property inherent in the categories
themselves but solely in how frequently the different categories are
populated.
