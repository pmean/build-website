> suffered an event that stirs strong emotions\--a miscarriage or a
> recent diagnosis of cancer, for example. There is something about
> tragedy that heightens people's memory. They search through their
> past to see if there is any explanation for what has just happened to
> them. It's not that they make up stuff, but it's more that the
> control group doesn't search as hard and will not recall events with
> the same level of detail. Also, the things they remember are risk
> factors that are described in the popular press, some of which are
> real risk factors, of course, and some of which are illusory.

>
> 1.  Although the person being interviewed knows whether they are in
>     the disease group or the control group, you can still use blinding
>     on the interviewer. If the interviewer does not know what group
>     the patient belongs to, he/she will not subconsciously probe a bit
>     harder for information from patients in a certain group (are you
>     sure you never smoked cigarettes?).
> 2.  Measure your risk factors several different ways. Sometimes you
>     can get information from a medical record and use it to supplement
>     the interview or to cross check certain pieces of information.
>     Both the interview and the medical record will have problems, of
>     course, but the combination of the two might help avoid some
>     problems with recall bias.
> 3.  Perform a quality audit of a fraction of your patients. You
>     probably won't have time to do this for every patient, but if you
>     could do some additional investigation for 5 or 10% of your
>     patients, that would give you a way of checking on the degree to
>     which both groups had problems recalling information.
