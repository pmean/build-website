**[StATS]:** **When should you worry about recall
bias? (August 3, 2006, Evidence, Mountain)**

> *Dear Professor Mean, I am studying reports of early health concerns
> in a group of children with a chronic disease compared to a matched
> group of healthy controls. I believe that the children in the disease
> group will have an increased rate of health problems in areas
> seemingly unrelated to their disease. But I am worried that there may
> be recall bias: the children and their parents will recall events in
> their past differently if they have the disease or not. What can I do
> about this?*
>
> Recall bias is always an issue in retrospective research, but
> sometimes it is a minor concern and sometimes it is a serious problem.
>
> I would be especially concerned about recall bias if you are asking
> about things that most people forget. So if you're asking about major
> surgery, that's something that pretty much everyone remembers, so
> there is little risk for recall bias. Dietary studies are trickier
> because who can remember exactly what foods they ate last week (I'm
> not even sure I remember what I ate last night).
>
> Subjectivity is also an important issue. If different people are
> likely to interpret the same event in different ways or if the event
> itself is difficult to pin down, then you need to worry. During an
> interview, Linus Pauling was extolling the virtues of Vitamin C. He
> pointed out that he and his family took Vitamin C supplements daily
> and nobody ever had trouble with colds. The interviewer pressed him on
> this, "No colds, ever?" Dr. Pauling replied, "No, just an
> occasional sniffle."
>
> The other thing to remember is that an inaccurate answer because some
> people forgot is not all that serious. You lose a bit of precision,
> but it doesn't cause any serious bias. The problem occurs when one
> group in your study has more difficulty with remembering than another
> group. Frequently this happens when one of your research groups has
> suffered an event that stirs strong emotions\--a miscarriage or a
> recent diagnosis of cancer, for example. There is something about
> tragedy that heightens people's memory. They search through their
> past to see if there is any explanation for what has just happened to
> them. It's not that they make up stuff, but it's more that the
> control group doesn't search as hard and will not recall events with
> the same level of detail. Also, the things they remember are risk
> factors that are described in the popular press, some of which are
> real risk factors, of course, and some of which are illusory.
>
> How do you overcome recall bias? Nothing can totally remove the
> problem of recall bias in retrospective studies, but sometimes there
> are approaches you can take that will ameliorate the problem. The
> approaches vary greatly depending on the type of research that you do,
> but here are a few general suggestions:
>
> 1.  Although the person being interviewed knows whether they are in
>     the disease group or the control group, you can still use blinding
>     on the interviewer. If the interviewer does not know what group
>     the patient belongs to, he/she will not subconsciously probe a bit
>     harder for information from patients in a certain group (are you
>     sure you never smoked cigarettes?).
> 2.  Measure your risk factors several different ways. Sometimes you
>     can get information from a medical record and use it to supplement
>     the interview or to cross check certain pieces of information.
>     Both the interview and the medical record will have problems, of
>     course, but the combination of the two might help avoid some
>     problems with recall bias.
> 3.  Perform a quality audit of a fraction of your patients. You
>     probably won't have time to do this for every patient, but if you
>     could do some additional investigation for 5 or 10% of your
>     patients, that would give you a way of checking on the degree to
>     which both groups had problems recalling information.
