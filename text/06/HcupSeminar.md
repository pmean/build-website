> On April 20, I will be attending a webcast sponsored by the Agency for
> Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) on a large data set they
> collected, the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. The acronym
> for this data set is HCUP, which I always pronounced HICCUP, but
> apparently, you are supposed to pronounce it H-CUP. That's not the
> first time I mispronounced an important acronym. I use a program
> called STATA, and I used to use a soft A (STAH-TA). But it is actually
> a hard A (STAY-TA).

> > The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) with inpatient data from a
> > national sample of over 1,000 hospitals. The Kids' Inpatient
> > Database (KID) is a nationwide sample of pediatric inpatient
> > discharges. The State Inpatient Databases (SID) contain the universe
> > of inpatient discharge abstracts from participating states. The
> > State Ambulatory Surgery Databases (SASD) contain data from
> > ambulatory care encounters from hospital-affiliated and sometimes
> > freestanding ambulatory surgery sites. The State Emergency
> > Department Databases (SEDD) contain data from hospital-affiliated
> > emergency departments for visits that do not result in
> > hospitalizations.*
