> and I was told it was okay to put the [PDF flier for this
> conference](../00files/LondonBrochure.pdf) on my web pages. I had to
> list a "Chairperson's Aid" form which asked for my three claims to
> fame: one work related, one humorous, and one that I am particularly
> proud of. Here's what I wrote:

> > *Three Claims To Fame:*
> >
> > *1) One Work Related: I'm the author of a book Statistical Evidence
> > in Medical Trials, recently published by Oxford University press. It
> > has not sold as well as Harry Potter yet*
> >
> > *2) One humorous: I have a statistics advice column on my web pages
> > called "Ask Professor Mean." and I remind people that he is "not
> > just your average professor."*
> >
> > *3) Something That You Are Particularly Proud Of: (This could be
> > anything, funny, serious or work related. From running a marathon
> > for charity, to the birth of a child, or growing old gracefully) Two
> > years ago, I adopted a little boy from Russia. He is four years old
> > now and he keeps me very busy.*

> I've prepared my handouts for these talks on my training page, and
> I've tried to make the talks general enough that I can use them in
> other situaitons. Here are the two talks but as of today (November 6,
> 2006), the second talk is much more complete than the first.
