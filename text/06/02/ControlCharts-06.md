**[StATS]:** **Learning more about control charts
(February 1, 2006)**.

> Someone asked me about resources for learning how to use control

> There are two excellent and very readable books that any beginner
> should look at:

> -   **Measuring Quality Improvement in Healthcare: A Guide to

>     RC (1995) New York: Quality Resources.
> -   **Understanding Variation: The Key to Managing Chaos.** Wheeler

> R is not an easy package to learn, but since it is programmable, you

> There is also a large amount of commercial software that you can buy.
> I don\'t have a lot of recommendations here, because I have not used
