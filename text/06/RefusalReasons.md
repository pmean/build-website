A participant in the IRB Forum raised a question about a research study
where people were asked to participate, and when some of them said
"no" they were then asked why they did not want to participate. The<U+FFFD>
reasons were tallied across all of the refusals, and percentages were
published as part of the full research study. Since the people had
already said "no" to participating in the research study, did that
also imply that they did not want to share information about their
reasons for not participating?

This is a difficult area, and most of the other comments in the IRB
Forum have been very critical. In contrast to those comments, I'd like
to defend this practice. The authors are trying to examine the extent to
which volunteer bias might influence the results of the research. This
is an important, but often neglected, issue in research. Almost every
research study requires informed consent. The major exceptions are
certain retrospective studies, certain studies in an emergency
situation, and studies involving a relatively benign intervention like
prayer.

Those people who offer consent to participate almost certainly differ
from those who refuse. One example that I recall from my earlier work at
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health involved
workplace studies of reproductive toxicants. When you go into a
workplace where there is exposure to a chemical that might make men
sterile, you usually don't have trouble recruiting volunteers. Even
with those people who are unconcerned about their ability to reproduce,
they usually end up volunteering to help out their co-workers.

But the control group is a different story. There is no strong incentive
to participate, because the chemical being studied is not a problem at
the place where you work. So you have to worry about volunteer bias.

It turns out that one of the benefits for participation is getting a
complete reproductive health assessment. Now the sort of person who
views this as an incentive might be someone who was wondering "Hmm, my
wife and I have been trying to have children for the past six months and
it just isn't working." If those are the sorts of people who volunteer
in greater numbers in the control group,<U+FFFD> you will end up with a very
bad bias in your research. Not all of the couples who have been trying
for six months will have problems, of course, but enough might to
seriously skew the control group.

So in these reproductive studies, we would always ask people for the
reason that they decided to participate (was it for the money? to help
out your co-workers? to get a free exam?) and if possible, we would ask
the people who refused as well why they declined to participate. I never
did those surveys, but as I recall, if someone refused to participate,
we would ask them if they would mind filling out a half page
questionnaire about their reasons for not participating. If the
participants differ from the refusals on these questions, especially if
the pattern of reasons is different between the control group refusals
and the exposed group refusals, you have learned something very valuable
about volunteer bias and about the limitations on generalizing the
results of this research.

It seems pretty obvious to me that some of the people would object to
all of the time and trouble required to participate in a full
reproductive assessment might not object to answering three questions on
a survey.

So if someone refused to participate in a research study, I do not see a
problem with asking them "why" as long as the researcher is not rude
or pushy. They always have the option of saying "none of your
business" but the ones who do agree to offer reasons help us to better
assess the scientific validity of the study.

Now, it is unclear if the research situation cited above showed adequate
respect for the patients' right to be left alone, but I know that if
you are careful, you can query refusals without violating their rights.
