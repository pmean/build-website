One of the more interesting research studies from an Evidence-Based
Medicine perspective started out as a simple science fair project by a
fourth grade student. Emily Rosa wanted to see if practitioners of
Therapeutic Touch could detect the energy fields in a carefully
controlled condition. The topic of this project was not too surprising,
since her parents both worked for the QuackWatch website, but Emily came
up with the idea entirely on her own. The science project received a lot
of publicity and Emily was encouraged to publish here results in a
medical journal. With the assistance of several adults, the publication,

-   **A close look at therapeutic touch.** L. Rosa, E. Rosa, L.
    Sarner, S. Barrett. Jama 1998: 279(13); 1005-10.

appeared, giving Emily Rosa something nice to put on her resume when she
applies to college. I'm still waiting for my first publication in an
"A journal" like JAMA, so I am quite jealous.

Here are a few excerpts from the publication:

> *In 1996 and 1997, by searching for advertisements and following other
> leads, 2 of us (L.R. and L.S.) located 25 TT practitioners in
> northeastern Colorado, 21 of whom readily agreed to be tested. Of
> those who did not, 1 stated she was not qualified, 2 gave no reason,
> and 1 agreed but canceled on the day of the test.*
>
> *The reported practice experience of those tested ranged from 1 to 27
> years. There were 9 nurses, 7 certified massage therapists, 2
> laypersons, 1 chiropractor, 1 medical assistant, and 1 phlebotomist.
> All but 2 were women, which reflects the sex ratio of the practitioner
> population. One nurse had published an article on TT in a journal for

> *The test procedures were explained by 1 of the authors (E.R.), who

A nice graphic showing the experimental setup is on the web at

-   <http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/279/13/1005/FIGJOC71352F1>

and I am going to try to get permission to use this figure on one of my
web page.

The results of the experiment were not good. In the original series of
trials, only 70 of the 150 guesses were correct (47%, 95% CI 37% to
57%). In the second series, only 53 of 130 guesses were correct (41%,
95% CI 32% to 50%).

<U+FFFD>I talk about this study on several places on these web pages:

I mostly repeat the same point, which is that this experiment, while
possibly oversimplifying the conditions under which, does still provide
convincing evidence against Therapeutic Touch.

When I used this example in a talk that I gave this week, someone asked
an interesting question. Even though the average performance was very
poor, was it possible that some of the participants performed very well?
After all, you only need one person who can reliably detect energy
fields to prove that there is something interesting going on.

This is sometimes called the "White Crow" argument, which was based on
the quote

> *To upset the conclusion that all crows are black, there is no need to
> seek demonstration that no crows are black; it is sufficient to
> produce one white crow; a single one is sufficient.* William James, as

There is some plausibility to this quote, and it is often used in an
attempt to salvage an otherwise negative research finding. As the
website above notes, if you find one honest Spiritualist medium, that
refutes the charge that all mediums are fakes. Perhaps so, but a
reasonable person should also infer that in any area that is rife with
fraud, you should be extremely careful in examining the evidence. As the
number of documented fraudulent cases increases, the standard of proof
should become increasingly high for any future claim made by a spiritual
medium.

Not knowing the individual results of the Emily Rosa study off the top
of my head, I did point out that any discipline where the average
practitioner performs more poorly than a coin flip is a discipline that
cannot be trusted in general. In particular, I would demand that a
practitioner of Therapeutic Touch demonstrate their ability in a blinded
experiment before I would consider giving them money for their services.

Going back today and re-reading the article, I noticed that the authors
set up individual thresholds of 8 correct responses out of 10 trials as
being an interesting individual result that would warrant replication.
The authors note that

> *Only 1 subject scored 8, and that same subject scored only 6 on the
> retest.*

which pretty much demonstrates that none of the 21 people tested could
reliably detect energy fields in a carefully controlled condition.

The reaction of the Therapeutic Touch community was either to attack the
research or ignore it. The attacks were quite vicious, actually, and
unwarranted. It reminds me of a quote by someone else confronted with
convincing evidence from a carefully controlled experiment that
discredited his fervently held beliefs:
