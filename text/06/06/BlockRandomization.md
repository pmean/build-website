**[StATS]:** **What is block randomization (June 30,
2006)**

Several people have asked me about block randomization, and while I
discuss it briefly on one of my web pages,

-   [Stats: Randomization](../plan/random.asp)

there is a better definition on the [Consort Statement web
site](http://www.consort-statement.org/) that defines several variations
of randomization including block randomization.

> *Blocking can be used to ensure close balance of the numbers in each
> group at any time during the trial. After a block of every 10
> participants, for example, five would be allocated to each arm of the
> trial (105). Improved balance comes at the cost of reducing the
> unpredictability of the sequence. Although the order of interventions
> varies randomly within each block, a person running the trial could
> deduce some of the next treatment allocations if they discovered the
> block size (106). Blinding the interventions, larger block sizes, and
> randomly varying the block size can ameliorate this problem.*

It is worth noting that a process that some people use, creating a
separate randomization list for different centers or for different
demographic groups in order to assure good balance across these
important factor, is actually stratified randomization and not block
randomization.
