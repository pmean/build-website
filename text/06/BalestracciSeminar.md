**[StATS]:** **Davis Balestracci seminar (January
19, 2006)**.

A couple of people I work with are very interested in applying quality
control in various processes at Children's Mercy Hospital. We already
have a quality improvement program in place, but these folks want to
incorporate some ideas they learned after attending a seminar by Davis
Balestracci at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement annual forum. I
was unfamiliar with Mr. Balestracci's work, but he has a very nice
website ([www.dbharmony.com](http://www.dbharmony.com)) that discusses
many of the left brain (analytic/rational) and right brain
(emotional/intuitive) issues associated with implementing a quality
program.

He has a nice quote on one of these web pages:

> *"The more you know what is wrong with your data\... the more useful
> it becomes." \--Prof. John Tukey*
> [www.dbharmony.com/brain/leftbrain.php\#1](http://www.dbharmony.com/brain/leftbrain.php#1)

Mr. Balestracci may be coming to Kansas City in June to give a talk in
June. It will be interesting to hear what he has to say.
