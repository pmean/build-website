humor. (February 13, 2006)**. [Category: Good

> I was recently asked to evaluate a book proposal, and although I have
> not finished it, it made me think about what makes a book good. There
> are several things that I look for in a book about Statistics, and one
> of those things (not necessarily the most important) is a good sense
> of humor.

> Statistics can be a rather dry and dull experience for many people, so
> a bit of humor can go a long way. An excellent example of the use of

> This sort of commentary continues throughout the entire book. At the
