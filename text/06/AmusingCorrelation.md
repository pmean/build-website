**[StATS]:** **An amusing correlation (June 5,
2006)**

I always like simple amusing examples that illustrate an important
statistical point. An email by JW on EDSTAT-L offer a couple of
examples.

The first is the statistician who reviewed fire department records and
concluded the more fire engines you send to the scene of a fire, the
more damage they cause. This is an example illustrating that it is not
necessarily A causing B, but rather B causing A. I have used this
example in my classes often.

A second example is good, and it is one that I had not heard before,
though it is apparently used quite commonly. See for example, the
Wikipedia entry on correlation and causation:

-   [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation\_implies\_causation\_(logical\_fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_implies_causation_(logical_fallacy))

This example shows a strong correlation between ice cream sales and
crime rates. The \"obvious\" interpretation is that ice cream causes
crime. A more logical interpretation is that both ice cream sales and
crime rate are correlated with outdoor temperature.
