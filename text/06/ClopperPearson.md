**[StATS]:** **An exact confidence interval for a
binomial proportion (created 2006-08-18)**.

> A researcher came into my office this morning with some data that was
> strongly negative. Out of 15 patients, none showed a detectable
> improvement after the use of a controversial treatment. That sounds
> like a strong negative result to me, but a reviewer asked a legitimate
> question: How do you know that you are not having problems with a Type
> II error?
>
> I would not have worded it quite that way, but the point is still
> good. Recall that a Type II error is accepting the null hypothesis
> when the null hypothesis is true. A common reason why a Type II error
> occurs is that the sample size was so small that there was
> insufficient power to reject the null hypothesis.
>
> So how do we know that 15 patients is an adequate sample size? It gets
> a bit tricky in this particular problem because there was no control
> group and no formal research hypothesis. In some situations, you might
> want to make a hypothesis about a change score, but for this data set,
> the values both before and after were always below the limit of
> detection, so there is no formal way to quantify the amount of
> improvement or lack thereof.
>
> The way around this problem is to note that the estimated proportion
> of improvements is zero and to place 95% confidence limits around
> these values. A simple approach that works is the [rule of
> three](../size/zeroevents.asp), but a more precise answer is to use
> the Clopper-Pearson method.
