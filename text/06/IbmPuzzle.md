**[StATS]:** **Mathematical and statistical
challenges (December 13, 2006)**

A regular poster on the EDSTAT-L list (DR) mentioned an interesting page
on the IBM website,
[www.research.ibm.com/ponder](http://www.research.ibm.com/ponder), that
offers a monthly puzzle on mathematical topics. Some of these topics
involve statistics and/or probability, such as the January 2006 puzzle:

> *Consider a loop of string of unit length. Suppose we cut the string
> independently and at random in n places. This will divide the loop
> into n pieces. This month\'s puzzle asks 1. What is the expected
> (average) size of the smallest piece? 2. What is the expected
> (average) size of the largest piece?*
