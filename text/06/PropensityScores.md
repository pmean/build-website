When I have time, I want to describe the use of propensity scores and
show some examples. Propensity scores offer a simple and effective way
to correct for covariate imbalance in an observational study. An
excellent reference on this technique can be found on the web at:

-   **[Estimation from nonrandomized treatment comparisons using
    subclassification on propensity
    scores](http://www.symposion.com/nrccs/rubin.htm)**. D. B. Rubin,
    Published in the Proceedings of the International Conference on
    Nonrandomized Comparative Clinical Studies in Heidelberg, April 10
