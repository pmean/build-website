I got an interesting question about an application in information theory
of a statistical distribution called the Type I extreme value
distribution. This distribution, also known as the Gumbel distribution,
is useful for modeling the maximum or minimum of a large number of
variables.

Reliability statistics often consider the maximum or minimum value as an
important quantity to measure. For example, if you have a machine with a
large number of components, and the machine fails when any one of the
components fails, then the lifetime of the machine is the minimum of the
individual component failure times. Insurance companies are also
interested in extreme values as they represent the worst case scenarios.
A 100 year flood level also represents an extreme value distribution.

There are two other distributions used to model extreme values (not
surprisingly they are called the Type II and Type III extreme value
distributions). Which distribution you use depends on factors like
whether the individual component distribution has finite moments and/or
a bounded tail. I'm not an expert on extreme value problems or
reliability statistics, so I looked up a few good resources.

A rather unusual approach to extreme values has been advocated by Benoit
Mandelbrot, probably the most famous name in the area of fractal
geometry.

The work by Mandelbrot may not be useful in the context of the original
question, but it is still a fascinating and very active area of
research.
