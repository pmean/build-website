**[StATS]:** **Frank Harrell\'s Philosophy of
Biostatistics (created 2006-10-10)**

> There are a lot of people in the world who are a lot smarter than I am

> Frank Harrell, chair of the Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt
> University, is one of those people. He has a book,

> that should be required reading for any statistician who is planning

> -   *Don\'t be afraid of using modern methods*
> -   *Avoid categorizing continuous variables and predicted values at
>     all costs*
> -   *Don\'t assume that anything operates linearly*
> -   *Account for model uncertainty and avoid it when possible by using
>     subject matter knowledge*
> -   *Use the bootstrap routinely*
> -   *Make the sample size a random variable when possible*
> -   *Consider using Bayesian methods*
> -   *Use excellent graphics, liberally*
