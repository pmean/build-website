**[StATS]:** **Should/Can Statistical
Consultants, be Independent? (December 14, 2006)**

> I attended a webinar, "Should (Can?) Statistical Consultants, be
> Independent?" presented by Janet Wittes.
>
> Statisticians are like Humpty-Dumpty (When I use a word\...), in that
> there are certain words (validated, prespecified, intent-to-treat, and
> independent) have special meanings just to statisticians. The talk
> focused on the last word, independent. Independent is not ignorant or
> uninterested (although disinterested meaning lack of conflict of
> interest is good).
>
> As statisticians are we an advocate, like a lobbyist, lawyer, or
> expert witness? An advocate's job is to fashion the best result for
> the client. An advocate who identifies with their client, they will
> use the word "we" in their conversation. An advocate should not be
> independent. An advocate and a client share the same interest.
>
> Contrast an advocate versus a consultant. Are you a hired gun? Is your
> fee contingent based? Does your job depend on the answer? Noted that a
> "hired gun" is not a "prostitute". The contrast listed below help
> to distinguish an advocate (first choice in the pair) from a
> consultant (second choice in the pair).
>
> -   Lobbyist vs. Advisor
> -   Best result vs. "Truth"
> -   Uses first person vs. uses second person
> -   Fires client who lies vs. Fires client who ignores our advice
> -   Not independent vs. Independent
>
> A third role is "collaborator". A collaborator is a "team member"
> and uses the pronoun "we" but is still interested in truth rather
> than the best result.
>
> It is important in a consulting environment to feel valuable, but
> perhaps more importantly, it is important we be perceived as important
> by our clients. It is critical that we "sit at the table" meaning
> participate actively rather than passively. It is important to talk
> and we need to talk in English, not in Statistics.
>
> Dr. Wittes offered a two dimensional grid. To the left is a reviewer
> and to the right is a team member. To the top is an advocate and to
> the bottom is a critic. A critic can actually be valuable in the sense
> of serving as a devil's advocate. Independence is on the lower
> portion of the grid (but not necessarily at the very bottom because an
> extreme critic is actually an advocate of the opposite side).
>
> Statisticians fall naturally into the role of critics, but it is hard
> not to let personal feelings move us into the role of advocates. Our
> clients want us to be advocates, but they grudgingly accept our role
> as critics.
>
> I asked two questions. First, when does the "best result" not
> coincide with the "truth"? Dr. Wittes distinguished between "not
> going beyond the truth" for an advocate versus "producing a neutral
> result without a particular spin" for a consultant.
>
> I also asked whether the distinction of an advocate versus a
> consultant changes when the goal of the project is to develop new
> software tools as opposed to producing a particular data analysis? Dr.
> Wittes agreed that new tools (and she added new methodologies) that
> advocacy is more troublesome when the
>
> Another person wanted to draw a distinction between consultation and
> collaboration by the depth of the involvement, and Dr. Wittes agreed
> and elaborated on this point. A collaboration needs to really get
> inside the problem and understand it thoroughly.
>
> Another person distinguished between these terms based on whether you
> actually see the data. To offer suggestions without seeing the data
> means you are a consultant. If you see the data, you are involved to a
> greater extent to become a collaborator.
>
> A fourth person worried that by translating our hard work into simple
> language, perhaps we are oversimplifying and hurting ourselves by
> hiding many of the complexities of the problem and making it seem that
> the work is easy enough for anyone to do. Dr. Wittes agreed and
> offered an analogy of scientific approaches that use "cartoons" to
> explain mechanisms and pathways.
>
> A fifth person asked do you see a difference between consulting with
> companies versus consulting with regulators. Dr. Wittes saw a huge
> difference. Regulators have to operate in a different framework.
>
> A sixth person asked if a consultant who has been paid as part of the
> grant be included or excluded as an author on any research
> publications. Dr. Wittes pointed out that the degree of collaboration
> and interaction will determine this. Sometimes our contributions are
> undervalued and we are not given enough credit for our work and
> sometimes our contributions are overvalued and a trivial effort is
> overstated. Sometimes researchers want our names on publications for
> political reasons. If there is a misperception about whether you are
> "part of the team" then you need to fix things.
>
> Dr. Wittes then offered her ten rules (guidelines) for consulting.
>
> **1. Know thyself.** Know what kind of analyses that you prefer, that
> you accept, that you grudgingly accept, that you hate, and that you
> wouldn't be associated with. Be honest with yourself\--there have to
> be things that you really hate to do.
>
> There is tension in your work when you are in a regulated environment.
> It is easy if you and the regulators are on the same side. But don't
> hide behind a regulator and use them as an excuse. When you disagree
> with the regulators, life is very hard. When you are more conservative
> than the regulators, you are in an especially difficult position
> because a less rigorous approach would still be accepted by the
> regulator. She offered the method "Last Observation Carried Forward"
> is not ideal, but which is still acceptable in some regulatory
> environments.
>
> **2. Learn the relevant nouns.** In theory, we can do the data
> analysis using abstract labels like x, y, and z. We never really know
> the scientific or technical area as well as the experts. But we work
> more effectively and are more credible when we know the language. You
> should not play a statistical "trust me" game.
>
> **3. Keep up to date.** You need to attend meetings and courses. You
> need to read journals and books. Examine your own behavior\--are you
> only using the methods that you learned in grad school or are you
> applying new methods?
>
> **4. Have some humility.** You need a reasonable but not a degrading
> amount of humility. It's okay to say "I don't know."
>
> **5. Work with people you like and respect.** Or you can train them to
> be likeable. An outsider can easily turn down work, because there will
> always be someone else who will take up the job. This is harder for an
> insider, especially if you are the lone statistician. You have to say
> yes to everyone, but you can use some balance. Spend more time and
> attention with those people you like and with those collaborations
> that are most lucrative to you.
>
> **6. Don't let yourself be abused.** There is hardly ever such a
> thing as a statistical emergency. Again this is more difficult
> internally. Just be frank if you can't do something\--the worst case
> is they'll find someone else. If you always respond, then you will
> get more and more abusive requests.
>
> **7. Train your clients to work in their interest.** You need to teach
> your client how to read (their is a lot of formal guidance available
> to scientists and technicians and they need to be familiar with this
> information.) Teach them that accuracy and precision matter (words and
> shades of meaning are very important to statisticians). Teach them
> that they can't hide bad news (someday the truth will emerge and then
> it's a disaster). Keep your critical eye fresh (know when you are
> being co-opted).
>
> Dr. Wittes told a story about a situation where data indicated that
> there was a safety problem with a certain drug. The people in the room
> minimized the problem and tried to argue against the data. Dr. Wittes
> finally blurted out "I wouldn't want any of you to be my doctor!"
> The conversation stopped for a while but when discussion resumed her
> comment was ultimately ignored. At the break though, several of the
> other people (other non-doctors in the room) spoke to her and thanked
> her for her honesty. The doctors needed to hear bad news from an
> outsider.
>
> **8. Don't be all things to all people.** Consulting is like a blind
> date. She offered a case study where a Phase 3 trial was ambiguous and
> the client believes that the data meets all the regulatory
> requirements, but the regulatory agency doesn't. You side with the
> agency. Do you go to the FDA and have them believe something about you
> that isn't true? Do you encourage the company not to submit and fail
> to serve their interests? A second case study involves a paper that
> you are a co-author on where you disagree with the tone, they omit
> something you want in, they give you too little time to respond. When
> do you remove your name? There are no easy answers to these cases.
>
> **9. Listen to what the client wants and know what your client should
> want.** Give them no more or no less than what they want. But teach
> the client what he/she should want, and be prepared to sever the
> relationship if the client is continually uninterested in important
> issues. This is just intellectual honesty.
>
> **10. Avoid being the unwitting agent of someone else's
> destruction.** You need to understand who is hiring you and why. There
> may be some political undercurrents that you need to be aware of. Are
> you being used as a tool or a pawn? Are you the first statistician
> involved or are you being used to attack the work of a previous
> statistician? If you are being hired as an outside consultant be sure
> to work closely with the internal statisticians.
>
> In conclusion, Dr. Wittes asked what you give up when you become a
> consultant. You give up the choice of problems that you work on and
> the intellectual ownership of problems. On the other hand, you gain
> the chance to work on many things, and the ability to contribute
> widely. For any given case, think about where you are on the
> reviewer/team member and critic/advocate axes. Make sure that your
> client is comfortable with where you are, and do midcourse corrections
> if there is a disparity in perceptions or if you are uncomfortable in
> your current role.
>
> One question was what you should do when you notice negative results
> or cautionary results in a regulated environment. Do you point this
> out to the client? to the regulator? Dr. Wittes said that you always
> disclose all information to your client. If the client does not want
> to disclose this information to the regulator, then you need to
> educate them that the statisticians at the regulatory agency are
> usually quite sharp and are likely to notice the same things that you
> noticed. Another participant pointed out that if there are negative or
> cautionary findings and you do not report them to the regulator, you
> will have a disaster on your hands.
