**[StATS]: Sales figures for Statistical Evidence in
Medical Trials (August 2, 2006)**

I get twice yearly data on sales, and the first of these arrived today.
I\'ve sold 230 copies, which is not bad for a short time frame. I
updated my page on the book and created a new page to list resources
associated with my book. I\'m hoping that now that my grant is done, I
can work extensively on promoting my book.
