Although I was expecting my book to appear sometime in February, a quick
search of the Internet shows that March 31, 2006 may be a more realistic
publication date. I have an ISBN for the book (0198567618) and there is
a limited amount of information at the BookFinder4U site, as well as at
Amazon and Barnes & Noble. See my web page about the book:

-   [Stats: Statistical Evidence](../evidence.asp)

for more details.
