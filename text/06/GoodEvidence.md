A correspondent on the evidence based health list noted a commonly
quoted statistic that only 10% of all medical practices are based on
solid evidence (e.g., randomized trials) and asked for any recent data
either supporting or refuting this statistic. I shared several resources
that I was aware of:

Robert Todd Carroll offers some historical perspective at

-   [www.skepdic.com/refuge/bunk8.html\#myth3](http://www.skepdic.com/refuge/bunk8.html#myth3)<U+FFFD>
    and
-   [skepdic.com/news/newsletter35.html](http://skepdic.com/news/newsletter35.html)<U+FFFD>

Dr. Carroll, with the help of some colleagues, traces the 10% figure
back to a 1968 study by Dr. Kerr White. Apparently, this was an armchair
estimate and was not based on any hard data. Anoter consideration, as
outlined in an Office of Technology Assessment report is that many
medical decisions are based on reasonable, but not rigorous evidence,
such as "*the use of vitamin B12 to treat pernicious anemia and cast
application for forearm fracture.*" Not cited by Dr. Carroll is the
humorous report in BMJ, Parachute use to prevent death and major trauma
related to gravitational challenge: systematic review of randomised
controlled trials. Smith GCS and Pell JP. BMJ 2003;327:1459-1461 (20
December), doi:10.1136/bmj.327.7429.1459.

Further work trying to identify the proportion of medical practices that
are based on solid evidence is summarized in

-   **The evidence for evidence-based medicine.** R. Imrie, D. W. Ramey.
    Complementary Therapies in Medicine 2000: 8(2); 123-6.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10859606&dopt=Abstract)
    [\[Full text\]](http://www.vet-task-force.com/CTiM.htm)

These authors also mention interventions that are self-evident and do
not require proof through randomized trials, such as

> *blood transfusions, starting the stopped hearts of victims with heart
> attacks, antibiotics for meningitis, or a tourniquet for a gushing
> wound.*

The authors then discuss research in anesthesia, dermatology, pediatric
surgery, hematology-oncology, and general practice that quantifies the
proportion of medical practices that are evidence based. While there is
substantial variation across the disciplines, the studies produce median
percentage of 78% for practices that have some evidence base and a
median percentage of 38% for practices that are supported by randomized
trials.

Another resource that discusses the proportion of medical practices that
are evidence based is

-   **"Is my practice evidence-based?"** T. Greenhalgh. British
    Medical Journal 1996: 313(7063); 957-8.

and the results presented in this paper are comparable to the previous
paper.
