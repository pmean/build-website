**[StATS]: Book reviews for Statistical Evidence
(October 5, 2006)**

The [International Journal of
Epidemiology](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/) published a review of my
book, Statistical Evidence in Medical Trials, in their September 15,
2006 issue. You need to be a subscriber or pay for access, but you can
find an excerpt at
[ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/extract/35/5/1368](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/extract/35/5/1368).

The review was fairly positive: Here's the last paragraph:

*This book is a clear, concise, and interesting read and should prove
to be a useful guide. The examples and case studies make it easy to
understand difficult concepts and the jokes and stories make it fun.
There are some salient points and hopefully the reader will be
enthused about looking at the published research and be more confident
about distinguishing between the good and the bad.*

Here's a snapshot form one of the [catalogs of the Oxford University
Press](http://www.oup.co.uk/academic/science/maths/mathcat/statscat06.pdf)
about my book.

To see if anything else was out there, I did a Google search for

-   book review "statistical evidence in medical trials"

There is a lot out there but not much of substance. Still, it's
flattering to be mentioned at all.

A review copy has been received by JAMA, according to their page, [Books
and Media Received, June 21,
2006](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/295/23/2794). Science
magazine also received a review copy according to their [Weekly Books
Received List, May 12,
2006](http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/books/brl5776.dtl).

The [LibraryLink weblog](http://blog.utmb.edu/abienkow/) has an entry,
[Evidence Based
Medicine/Practice](http://blog.utmb.edu/abienkow/?page_id=161), that
cites several books as resources, including mine. Their brief comment is
that my book

*is an introduction to research design and to understanding what the
numbers reported in clinical trials mean for practice decisions.*

Several libraries have added my book to their collection. The [Alcuin
Research Resource Centre](http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/arrc/) at the
[University of York](http://www.york.ac.uk) listed my book among dozens
of others, but took the time to provide a nice summary for each book.
This is what they wrote about my book.

*Describes how to appraise the quality of evidence presented in the
medical literature. Chapters look at the quality of the control group,
exclusion criteria, clinical relevance of the outcome measure,
corroborating evidence, meta-analysis and systematic review,
explanation of statistics used, and how to search for research
articles.*

A Chinese web site, [CTI Book](http://www.ctibook.com/ctibook/), has a
[spreadsheet listing over a thousand math books with brief
commentaries](http://www.ctibook.com/2006eb/list/Mathematics.xls).
Here's what they said about my book:

*Aimed at students and researchers in statistics and in the medical
and health care sector as well as those who use and assess medical
data, this book addresses common pitfalls in experimental design. The
text focuses on the errors and misleading data that stem from flawed
experiments, misreading of results and misuse of statistical and
analytical methods in medical research.*

The U.S. Amazon site has no reviews of my book, but the U.K Amazon site
has [one review from Benoy N.
Shah](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0198567618/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/202-8564882-7566257?ie=UTF8):

*I am a doctor working in the field of Cardiology, so the need to
understand and interpret clinical trials is vital. I flicked through
this book (before buying it) and was instantly captured by the honest
and open style with which it is written. A lot of jargon, which has
the ability to confuse, is neatly explained and relevant and frequent
examples are very handy.*

*The Lancet has recently published a book called The Lancet Handbook
of Essentials Concepts in Medical Research which I flicked through
too. Though it has a more alluring cover, this book certainly reads
more easily than that did.*

*The reson this book doesn't get five stars, however, is due to the
numerous grammatical errors. I almost can't believe the proof-reading
of the script didn't pick them up. Incorrect use of commas and
apostrophes are common, as are extra incorrect words (e.g. "If the
overall a sample has a skewed demographic,...). If this can be sorted
out for the second edition, that would be a big step forward.*

*Overall, this book is excellent and I would highly recommend it to
anyone wishing to learn more about interpreting clinical research. I
would also recommend that the publishers read the book and eliminate
the multiple grammatical inaccuracies.*

Amazon has an algorithm that recommends buying pairs of related items,
and when I looked at the Amazon page for my book, here is what they
recommended:

It is a true honor that the folks at Amazon think that Jane Austen and I
are perfect partners.
