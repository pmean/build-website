> I am co-author on over 60 papers and have helped with the publication
> of many more papers. What does it take to get a co-authorship? I
> don't quibble a lot about this, but it seems everyone has their own
> standard. When I am asked, I tend to discourage listing me as a
> co-author if all I did was perform a routine (routine to me, anyway)
> data analysis. If the analysis is very difficult and/or uses new and
> uncommon approaches, then I would tend to seek co-authorship. Also, if
> I helped with writing a substantial section of the paper itself,
> co-authorship is probably warranted.

> reasonable limit to this of course, or no statistician would ever be

> papers were penned almost entirely by a professional writer hired by a
> pharmaceutical firm and then offered to prominent academic researchers
> to be published under their names. This hides the obvious conflict of
> interest that a paid professional writer would have and allows a drug
> company to get favorable statements published that their marketing
> representatives can use to promote their products.

> There's a lot that has been written recently about abuses of
> co-authorship, including the recent cloning scandal in South Korea.
> When I get time, I want to include a few links and references about
> this.
