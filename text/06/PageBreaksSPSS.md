**[StATS]:** **Changing page breaks in SPSS (August
31, 2006)**

SPSS often chooses some unusual and unfortunate places to make a page
break. You can fix this, according to a helpful soul on the SPSSX-L
listserv (MG). Just tell SPSS never to use page breaks (in other words,
print a single page and let your printer make the page breaks) by
entering the command

-   `set length=none`

in the command syntax window. You can also do this from the menu system
by selecting EDIT | OPTIONS from the menu.

Click on the VIEWER tab and select an infinite length for LENGTH.
