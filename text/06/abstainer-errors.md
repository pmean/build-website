A correspondent in the
[MedStats](../category/InterestingWebsites.html#MeStXx) email discussion
group (RR), mentioned an interesting example of problems in defining
groups in observational studies. The actual publication is

-   Kaye Fillmore et al. "Moderate alcohol use and reduced mortality
    risk: systematic error in prospective studies." Addiction Research
    and Theory. Advanced online publication March 30, 2006.

I cannot find this particular article yet, but there are several news
reports about this study that are on the Internet.

The basic finding of the original research is that much of the data that
appears to show that moderate drinking is mildly protective might be
flawed in that the comparison group, those who abstain from alcohol,
includes a significant number of people who are only abstaining because
they are ill and their doctor advised them to stop drinking. Thus, it
might be the ill health that precipitated the abstention rather than the
abstention leading to slightly worse outcomes. If you look at studies
that define abstention as never having consumed alcohol, the difference
in risk compared to moderate drinkers disappears. Of course, both groups
always look much better than the heavy alcohol consumption group.

I'll try to find the original research article and produce a summary
here. It is an interesting example of how defining a control group
without the benefit of randomization can sometimes lead to faulty
conclusions.
