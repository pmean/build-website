**[StATS]:** **Resources for Item Response Theory
(June 28, 2006)**

One area that I would like to investigate when I have time is Item
Response Theory (IRT). This is an approach that is sometimes called a
latent trait model or a Rasch model, though there are some technical
distinctions between these terms.

IRT is popular in testing as it allows for the modeling of the
difficulty of individual questions on a test and their ability to
discriminate among individuals of different abilities. It can also be
used for examining the validity of a scale that consists of the sum of a
number of Likert scale items (or in general a sum of ordinal scale
items).

There is a free library in R to perform these calculations,

-   [cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/ltm.html](http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/ltm.html)

and some very nice web resources describing IRT at

An interesting application of IRT appears at
