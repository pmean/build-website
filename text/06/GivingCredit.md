> A lot of the material that I present on these web pages comes from

> plug for the groups when I can, but I realized that I should also give
> credit to the individuals who regularly contribute to these groups. I
> don\'t want to publish full names because some of these people may
> value their privacy (they are willing to share their thoughts on a
> limited forum, but may not want to have their names bandied about in a
> different forum). On the other hand, I do want to give credit where
> credit is due, and some of these people do deserve a pat on the back.
