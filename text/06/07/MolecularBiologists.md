**[StATS]:** **Seminar notes: Working with molecular
biologists (July 17, 2006)**.

> One of the talks at the 18th Annual Applied Statistics in Agriculture
> Conference, sponsored by Kansas State University was \"A visual aid to
> help a statistician work with a molecular biologist\" by Debbie Boykin
> of the USDA Agricultural Research Service, coauthored by Earl
> Taliercio, also of the USDA Agricultural Research Service and Rowena
> Kelly from Mississippi State University. The original title of the
> talk was \"Improving Power of Microarray Experiments by Adjusting Data
> so Fewer Differentially Expressed Genes are Overlooked\" but Dr.
> Boykin reviewed the material and decided to change the focus.
>
> Dr. Boykin\'s efforts to work with molecular biologists have not been
> easy. She warned us that these people speak a different language. The
> statistician needs to invest some time in learning about the
> technology in order to understand the problems. The scientists, on the
> other hand are not used to using a statistical model or experimental
> design to deal with variability.
>
> She emphasized the use of simple graphical tools. Just plotting the
> data, and the residual deviations (there are several ways of defining
> deviation), can lead to some interesting and valuable insights.
>
> She had some practical suggestions if there is a lot of problems with
> variation. If you remove a single spot for each gene that contributes
> the most variation, and re-analyze the data, then you could see if the
> ranking of the most important genes changes. A very interesting gene
> to look at carefully is one that was rated very poorly on the original
> data, but which is very important after removing a single data point.
> The thing to keep in mind is that in most microarray experiments, a
> Type II error is far more serious than a Type I error.
