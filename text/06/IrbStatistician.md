Someone on the [IRBForum](http://www.irbforum.org) wrote in and asked
what guidance their IRB could offer to a statistician who was just
assigned to an Institutional Review Board (IRB). There were many good
responses. I wrote in with a few comments of my own.

A statistician, especially one fresh from graduate school, might feel a
bit perplexed at all the issues that arise in an IRB. Certainly they are
not qualified to answer questions like whether lumbar puncture qualifies
as minimal risk. But they can and should offer unique contributions to
the IRB.

There's a quote that I find particularly relevant here.

My belief is that statisticians, because of their intimate involvement
with the scientific method, can ask a lot of important and valuable
questions. They are not qualified to answer those questions, of course.

There is a lot of research that just doesn't make any sense because the
researchers are collecting the wrong data. Statisticians are especially
adept at sniffing this out. They are also good at understanding the
limitations of observational data, and the controversies associated with
early stopping of clinical trials.

From my experience on various committees where I am the sole
statistician amidst a group of content experts, the most common
questions you will get will be about whether the data analysis approach
suggested in the research is appropriate or not. I get lots of comments
like "Aren't you ALWAYS supposed to use a median to summarize your
data when it is highly skewed?" The people who ask these types of
questions are what I call "half smart" in that they know enough to
comment on an important controversy, but not quite smart enough to think
things through to their logical conclusion. Beware of people who get
excessively dogmatic about data analysis issues ("This is the way I
analyzed the data for my dissertation, so any other approach must be
wrong.")

Life is too short to quibble about data analysis. There are a few things
worth fighting about (such as failure to recognize and take advantage of
pairing in a data set), but most of these mean/median style
controversies are overblown. There is more than one way to analyze the
data, and your goal ought to be to make sure that the analysis is
defensible rather than trying to make the analysis methods perfect.

I've had several people argue with me about this, but I believe that an
important role of the statistician is to get people to think more about
how the data is being collected and less about how it is being analyzed.
After all, the fanciest analysis in the world won't save you if you end
up collecting the wrong data.

As a statistician, your participation on an IRB will make you a better
statistician. You will learn about a lot of important issues, such as
confidentiality, and learn them in great detail. Then when you are
helping a colleague in the early planning stages of the research (all
your doctors come to you early in the planning stages, don't they?)
then you will be able to make them aware of important ethical issues
that can and should influence their research design.

By the way, we statisticians have a certain reputation when it comes to
ethical issues, and it is best illustrated with the following story. A
manager wanted to hire someone to work in her department and she had
applications from a lawyer, an archeologist, and a statistician. She
invited the lawyer for an interview and asked just a single question,
"*What is one plus one?*" The lawyer explained "*In matters of
commercial law, the Supreme Court precedent in 1867 established that, in
matters of commercial law, one plus one is considered to be prima facie
evidence of equaling two.*" The manager was very impressed. Then she
invited the archeologist for an interview and asked the same question.
The archeologist replied, "*Although many ancient cultures had solid
concepts of numbers, the concept of addition was first established in
the Egyptian culture, circa 2000 B.C. and it was at the tomb of
Amenhotep that the first written evidence was found to establish that
one plus one was equal to two.*" Again the manager was very impressed.
She then invited the statistician in and asked "*What is one plus
one?*" The statistician looked around very carefully, then went up and
closed the door, lowered the window shades, and asked very quietly
"*What do you want it to be?*"
