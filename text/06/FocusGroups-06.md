> This is a very nice article with the full free text available on the
> web. It has an excellent bibliography and many of the references also
> have full free text on the web. The authors followed a series of steps
> that they argue can be readily generalized to other safety issues:
>
> 1.  Prepare systematic reviews of the existing literature,
> 2.  Compile a list of proposed interventions
> 3.  Reduce the list to a manageable number
> 4.  Meet with interested parties
> 5.  Verify meeting summaries with participants
> 6.  Fill in remaining gaps with personal interviews, and
> 7.  Develop an action plan based on the input provided.

> The authors discussed the concept of "saturation." How many focus
> groups do you need to convene? The answer is dependent on the input
> you get at successive meetings. When "the same points are reiterated
> in all groups and ideas become repetitive" then saturation has
> occurred and you have a sufficient sample size. The authors cite a
> rule of them that six meetings are needed to reach saturation. In the
> paper, the authors mention that four meetings were initially planned,
> they determined that sufficient saturation had not occurred so they
> scheduled two additional meetings.
>
> The authors stressed the importance of striking a **balance** between
> **presenting** theoretical findings and **listening** to practical
> barriers. The authors noted that
>
> > *The collective knowledge of participants provided many local
> > insights unlikely to emerge in conventional research. Discussion
> > topics covered key partners and sectors to include when planning a
> > program; national policies and programs that could be used to drive
> > the agenda; potential sources of funding; the importance of
> > providing and installing appropriate smoke alarms; targeting of
> > programs; and suggestions for gaining access to hard-to-reach
> > populations.*

> This article makes a strong argument for the value of qualitative
> information and offers a good model for how to use focus groups to
> collect this information.
