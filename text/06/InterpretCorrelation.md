**[StATS]:** **Interpretation of the correlation
coefficient (April 4, 2006)**

There are many "rules of thumb" about how to interpret a correlation
coefficient. They vary slightly from one to another, but all say about
the same thing. Here's a couple of interpretations I found on the web
today:

> *One old classic and typical interpretation of "r" uses five easy
> "rules of thumb" to answer the question "When is a correlation
> coefficient "high" and when is it "low"? as follows:\
> "r" ranging from zero to about .20 may be regarded as indicating no
> or negligible correlation.\
> "r" ranging from about .20 to .40 may be regarded as indicating a
> low degree of correlation.\
> "r" ranging from about .40 to .60 may be regarded as indicating a
> moderate degree of correlation.\
> "r" ranging from about .60 to .80 may be regarded as indicating a
> marked degree of correlation.\
> "r" ranging from about .80 to 1.00 may be regarded as indicating
> high correlation.\

> Harcourt, Brace & World. (Chap. 7)\]*
>
> *Other more recent scholars explain, simply, "as a rule of thumb, we
> can say that correlations of less than .30 indicate little if any
> relationship between the variables." \[See: Hinkle, Wiersma, & Jurs
> (1988), Applied Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, 2nd ed.,
> Houghton Mifflin Co.\]*
