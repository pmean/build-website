> **[Young Epidemiology Scholars
> Competition](http://www.collegeboard.com/yes/index.html)**. College
> Entrance Examination Board, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Accessed
> on 2006-05-30. **(Teaching resources, Internet)** \[Excerpt\] *The
> future health of the American population depends in large part upon
> the knowledge and ability of our upcoming health leaders,
> practitioners and researchers. The Young Epidemiology Scholars (YES)
> Competition for original student research is designed to inspire
> talented students to investigate the many behavioral, biological,
> environmental and social factors that affect health and, based upon
> this knowledge, to identify ways to improve the health of the public.
> The YES Competition offers college scholarship awards to high school
> juniors and seniors who conduct outstanding research projects that

> **[Comparing Two Measurement Devices. Part
> I](http://www.tufts.edu/~gdallal/compare.htm)**. Gerard E. Dallal.
> Accessed on 2006-05-26. **(Model, Agreement)** \[Excerpt\] *It\'s rare
> when a paper says everything that needs to be said in a way that can
> be readily understood by a nontechnical audience, but this is one of
> those cases. The paper is \"Statistical Methods for Assessing
> Agreement Between Two Methods of Clinical Measurement,\" by JM Bland
> and DG Altman (The Lancet, February 8, 1986, 307-310). Perhaps it is
> so approachable because it was written for medical researchers three
> years after an equally readable version appeared in the applied
> statistics literature (Altman and Bland, 1983) and about the same time
> as a heated exchange over another approach to the problem (Kelly,
> 1985; Altman and Bland, 1987; Kelly, 1987). This could very well have
> been a two-sentence note: \"Here\'s the Bland and Altman reference.
> Please, read it.\" Still, its message is so elegant by virtue of its
> simplicity that it\'s worth the time and space to review the approach
> and see why it works while other approaches do little more than
> confuse the issues.* www.tufts.edu/\~gdallal/compare.htm
