> Accessed on 2006-05-26. **(Model, Agreement)** \[Excerpt\] *It's rare
> when a paper says everything that needs to be said in a way that can
> be readily understood by a nontechnical audience, but this is one of
> those cases. The paper is "Statistical Methods for Assessing
> Agreement Between Two Methods of Clinical Measurement," by JM Bland
> and DG Altman (The Lancet, February 8, 1986, 307-310). Perhaps it is
> so approachable because it was written for medical researchers three
> years after an equally readable version appeared in the applied
> statistics literature (Altman and Bland, 1983) and about the same time
> as a heated exchange over another approach to the problem (Kelly,
> 1985; Altman and Bland, 1987; Kelly, 1987). This could very well have
> been a two-sentence note: "Here's the Bland and Altman reference.
> Please, read it." Still, its message is so elegant by virtue of its
> simplicity that it's worth the time and space to review the approach
> and see why it works while other approaches do little more than
> confuse the issues.* www.tufts.edu/\~gdallal/compare.htm
