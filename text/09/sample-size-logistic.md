I might need to do a sample size justification for a logistic regression model. How would this be done? Let me outline some simple cases.

If you are using a binary independent variable, the logistic regression model simplifies to a two by two table. Specify the margin distribution of the independent variable. Is it likely to split about 50-50, or is it more likely to split 20-80? Then for the "control" level, specify what you expect the proportion to be. Specify how much of a change from the "control" level to the "treatment/exposure" level is considered important from a clinical perspective. Then run some calculations based on this table. You have several choices including a power calculation for the difference in two proportions and a power calculation based on the asymptotic normality of the log odds ratio.

Here's an example based on a publication using logistic regression:
