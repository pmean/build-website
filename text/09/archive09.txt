   <li><a href="../09/TwoByTwo.html">P.Mean: Entering and analyzing data from a 
  two by two table, using PASW/SPSS (created 2009-12-14)</a>. One of the most common questions I hear is how to enter and analyze data 
  from a two by two crosstabulation. It is not immediately obvious, especially 
  to beginners, how to get started with this type of data. The table shown below 
  presents some data and statistics from several two by two crosstabulations. How do you take information 
  like this and enter it into PASW/SPSS, 
  so that you can produce a useful analysis?<br>

   problems using R (created 2009-11-30)</a>. To help drill simple concepts in 
   math for my second grade son, I developed a series of R programs to generate 
   these problems randomly. It makes use of the sample function on a sequence of 
   integers and allows you to limit or expand the scope of the problems 
   generated. It is far from perfect, but it shows a few simple tricks in R.</li>
   <li><a href="ExcelMultinomial.html">P.Mean: Generating multinomial random 
   variables in Excel (created 2009-11-23)</a>. Someone asked how to generate 
   six random integers subject to the conditions that the sum of those random 
   integers had to equal a value, x. This is a classic description of a 
   multinomial distribution. Unstated in the question, but assumed by me, was 
   that each random integer had to have the same distribution. that forces the 
   probability vector for the multinomial to be (1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6).</li>

   that people would meet at a different location than the previous round and 
   with a different mix of people. So on the first round of meetings, Allen, 
   Barb, Charlie, and Denise would meet at location E and Fred, Gina, Harry, and 
   Iona would meet at location J. On the next round, you'd mix things up so that 
   it wasn't the same four people at the same location. <br>

   <li><a href="IneligiblePatients.html">P.Mean: Sneaking ineligible patients 
   into a clinical trial (created 2009-10-30)</a>. There was an interesting 
   article in the New York Times (Chen PW. Bending the Rules of Clinical Trials) 
   that described a terminal cancer patient and the doctor's goal to get them 
   access to a new experimental drug, even though the patient was not eligible 
   for the clinical trial that was studying this drug. It's a difficult 
   situation for doctors. Do you do what's best for the patient in front of you, 
   knowing that the data collected from this patient might corrupt the findings 
   of the clinical trial?</li>
   <li><a href="NormalPlot.html">P.Mean: What is a normal probability plot? 
   (created 2009-10-29)</a>. The normal probability plot, sometimes called the qq plot,
is a graphical way of assessing whether a set of data looks like it
might come from a standard bell shaped curve (normal distribution). To compute a 
normal probability plot, first sort your data, then compute evenly spaced 
percentiles from a normal distribution. Optionally, you can choose the normal 
distribution to have the same mean and standard deviation as your data, or you 
can save some time by using evenly spaced percentiles from a standard normal 
distribution. Finally, plot the evenly spaced percentiles versus the sorted 
data. A reasonably straight line indicates a distribution that is close to 
normal. A markedly curved line indicates a distribution that deviates from 
normality.</li>
   <li><a href="RocLayout.html">P.Mean: Data layout for an ROC curve (created 
   2009-10-16)</a>. Back in 1999, I wrote a brief description of the ROC curve

   analysis to the one used by the principal investigator. I'm happy to help and 
   will offer advice about why my approach may be better, but I was warned that 
   the PI considers the analysis chosen to be ordained by the &quot;Statistic Gods&quot; 
   at her place of work. I'm not sure what to make of the words &quot;Statistic 
   Gods&quot;.</li>
   <li><a href="LikertAnova.html">P.Mean: Use of Likert data with ANOVA (created 
   2009-10-13)</a>. <i>I never quite feel I can offer my students a thoughtful 
   explanation about the use of Likert data with ANOVA. It is recommended that 
   ANOVA be used with interval or ratio data, but, in practice, ANOVA is 
   sometimes used when the data is ordinal (as you'd find when using Likert 
   scales). This confuses some students. Are there any good references out there 
   I can share with my students that might explain the pros and cons of using 
   ordinal data with ANOVA?</i></li>

   2009-05-29)</a>. I got an email from a researcher on a project I was peripherally involved 
  with awhile back. Here's what she wrote (with a few details removed to protect 
  anonymity). <i>As you all are aware, enrollment for the BLANK study has been slower 
  than anticipated. However, due to a high suspicion that patients in the 
  CONTROL arm were having more complications (more rescue therapy) and less 
  improvement, we have decided to look at the data prior to reaching our initial 
  proposed N=140. We had 79 patients enrolled. We found that significantly more 
  patients in the TREATMENT arm reported that their main symptom was better at 
  24 hours than the CONTROL arm (p=0.02). Also, we had 6 patients need some kind 
  of rescue, 5 of those were in the CONTROL arm (this approached statistical 
  significance, p=0.08). Therefore, I am writing to see if you agree with 
  stopping the study at this point. Please let me know at your earliest

   <li><a href="TooSensitive.html">P.Mean: The problem with being too sensitive 
   or too specific (created 2009-09-16)</a>. Somebody asked my opinion about

   understand why it is controversial. Here's the logic that I presented to draw 
   that conclusion.</li>

   <i>&quot;I am working on a prediction model to help with diagnosis. In this 
   particular area I need a model that has the highest possible sensitivity (low 
   specificity is not a problem).&quot; </i>One obvious comment is that you can 
   achieve a sensitivity of 100% if you don't mind a specificity of 0%. So when 
   you say &quot;low specificity is not a problem&quot; that statement is only partially 
   true. What you mean to say is that false negatives are far more serious than 
   false positives. How much more serious, though. Five times? Ten times? Once 
   you've decided the relative costs of false negatives and false positives, the 
   rest is easy.<br>

   standardized beta coefficients (created 2009-09-12)</a>. I have a client who 
   is working on her dissertation. I always warn people working on dissertations 
   or theses that they should listen more to what their committee members say 
   about statistics than what I say about statistics. If the committee loves the 
   statistical analysis and I hate it, you still get your degree. If I love the 
   statistical analysis and the committee hates it, you get nothing. For this 
   client, a committee member asked if she could produce standardized beta 
   coefficients in her regression models. I helped her write an argument as to 
   why the unstandardized coefficients are better, but the committee member gave 
   a reasonable counter-argument, so there was no point in persisting. Still, it 
   would be helpful here to outline some of the controversy over standardized 
   beta coefficients.</li>

   imputation, and I may have to program some of the work myself. I can use the 
   R package MICE to generate the imputed data sets, but then I have to use a 
   mixed linear model rather than a linear model. How do I combine the estimates

   description of the sorts of things to examine was quite elaborate, and it 
   ended with the question &quot;<i>how many families would we need to have any

   phenomenon called &quot;citation amnesia.&quot; This is the tendency of researchers to 
   overlook previously published work in the bibliography of their articles. 
   Most of the respondents felt that citation amnesia was a problem. &quot;Indeed, 
   the vast majority of the survey's roughly 550 respondents -- 85% -- said that 
   citation amnesia in the life sciences literature is an already-serious or 
   potentially serious problem. A full 72% of respondents said their own work 
   had been regularly or frequently ignored in the citations list of subsequent 
   publications. Respondents' explanations of the causes range from 
   maliciousness to laziness.&quot; There are several problems with this survey,

   <li><a href="FewerThanTen.html">P.Mean: Fewer than 10 events per variable 
   (created 2009-02-18)</a>. <i>I am in the 
  process of advising on the design of a study using logistic regression. There 
   are five confounding variables and a treatment variable. If I apply the rule 
   that you need 10 events per variable (EPV), then I need 60 events. I expect 
   that the probability of observing an event is 40%. This means that I'll need 
   data on 60 / 0.4 = 150 patients. I can only collect data on 90 patients, and 
   that sample size gives me more than adequate power. Since my power will be 
   fine, can I ignore the rule of thumb about 10 EPV?</i></li>
   <li><a href="NegativeAutocorrelation.html">P.Mean: Interpreting a negative 
   autocorrelation (created 2009-02-16)</a>. <i>I have two questions regarding 
   autocorrelation: if there is negative autocorrelation is it correct to say 
   that &quot;past values decreasingly influence future values? Why is positive 
   auto-correlation considered more important by most statisticians.</i></li>
   <li><a href="AcknowledgingContributions.html">P.Mean: Acknowledging the 
   contributions of a statistician (created 2009-02-16)</a>. <i>A while back you 
   assisted me with stats on my paper. I am finally ready to submit and wanted 
   to know how I should appropriately acknowledge you for your participation 
   since you are no longer at Children's Mercy Hospital.</i><br>

   <li><a href="InformationCalibration.html">P.Mean: Calibrating information 
   using a two by two table (created 2009-01-28)</a>. In a previous webpage, I discussed the concept of joint entropy, 
  conditional entropy, and information. The information for two measurements is 
  zero if the two measurements are statistically independent. Information 
  increases between two measurements as the degree of dependence (either 
  positive or negative) increases. I thought it would be helpful to visualize 
  this relationship graphically.</li>
   <li><a href="AdjustedHazardRatio.html">P.Mean: Changes in the adjusted hazard 
   ratio, but not in the precision of the ratio (created 2009-01-19)</a>. <i>
   Does anyone know a good reference on why, in Cox regression of a clinical 
   trial, including covariates often changes the treatment hazard ratio rather 
   than narrowing the confidence interval? I can remember attending a talk on 
   this years ago, but cannot remember the details.</i></li>
   <li><a href="MathematicalGraphs.html">P.Mean: Drawing simple mathematical 
   graphs (created 2009-01-14)</a>. <i>I'm looking for a good, basic, relatively 
   easy-to-use graphing program, to draw simple mathematical graphs one would 
   see in basic calculus, algebra, statistics. Something similar to Paint, but a 
   step or two up from it, and that I could copy and paste images, venn 
   diagrams, etc., into a Word file, and the quality would be publication 
   quality. I want something that is MUCH more versatile than one would get 
   using Excel or similar.</i></li>
   <li><a href="JointEntropy.html">P.Mean: A simple example of joint and 
   conditional entropy (created 2009-01-07)</a>. In a project involving sperm 
   morphology classification, I have found that the concept of entropy very 
   useful in analyzing the data and describing certain patterns. I want to 
   extend the work to include joint and conditional entropy. I wanted to start 
   with a simple data set, so I downloaded a file from the Data and Story 
   Library website. There is an interesting file &quot;High Fiber Diet Plan&quot; that 
   provides a useful way to explore joint and conditional entropy.</li>
   <li><a href="PowerpointDefense.html">P.Mean: Maybe Powerpoint isn't so bad 
   (created 2009-01-06)</a>. I have been harshly critical of PowerPoint in the 
   past (though I did post a rejoinder from one of the readers of my old 
   website). Most of my criticisms were inspired by Edward Tufte, who wrote an 
   article for Wired magazine (Powerpoint is evil) and a short monograph (The 
   Cognitive Style of Powerpoint). In preparing a newsletter article about 
   Edward Tufte and his new book, Beautiful Evidence, I came across some 
   reviewers who take Dr. Tufte to task for his harsh criticisms of Powerpoint.</li>
