The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) convened a
task force to address the increasing tendency of people to refuse to
respond (as is their right) to a survey. This group prepared a report,
published in September 2014, documentation what is a refusal and
characterizes who refuses to participate in surveys. The report also
discusses efforts to persuade initially reluctant individuals to
participate (refusal conversion) and how that effort might infringe on
someone's privacy. If you are conducting almost any type of survey, you
will have to confront participation refusals, and this document can
serve as a starting point for handling the conflicting demands of
scientific integrity and an individual's right to be left
alone.
