This blog entry from the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation
talks about the deficiency in many research proposals sent to that
organization. They rely too much on standardized effect sizes, which are
impossible to interpret and often misleading. The authors also criticize
the Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) that are included in the
sample size justification for many cluster based or hierarchical
research designs. The ICCs, they say, often seem to be pulled out of
thin air. It is a hard number to get sometimes and they suggest that you
consider a range of ICCs in your calculations or that you run a pilot
study.
