I've always been a big fan of data sharing, mostly for selfish reasons.
I like to see interesting data sets and use them as teaching examples
and on my website. There are unselfish reasons for sharing data: such as
the increase in research transparency and the ability to pursue new
avenues of research. But if we want to see more progress in sharing
data, there need to be some improvements in public data archives, In
particular, there needs to be more flexibility in data embargoes, better
communication between the original data set owners and those who would
like to re-use their data, better understanding of the ethics of data
re-use, and more rewards for those who take the time and trouble to
share their data.
