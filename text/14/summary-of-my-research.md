My boss at UMKC (I'm part-time at UMKC and part-time independent
statistical consultant) asked me for one of those "summarize the
research you've been working on" so she could mention all the work being
done by our Department for a talk she's giving. Recently, I've been
focused almost exclusively on one thing, and although she knew it very
well, I sent her a summary anyway. Then, I thought, why not share the
same summary on my blog. Maybe you're curious or maybe you might be
interested in collaborating. So here's my summary about my work on
Bayesian models for patient accrual in clinical trials.

<!---More--->

Slow accrual of patients in clinical trials is the most critical factor
hampering the completion of clinical trials and represents significant
threat to the integrity of research. Delays in the completion of trials
damage our ability to evaluate novel therapies and interventions in a
timely fashion and undermine the Nuremberg Code's mandate that research
should "yield fruitful results for the good of society." In
collaboration with researchers at Kansas University Medical Center,
Steve Simon has helped develop a Bayesian model for patient accrual that
incorporates historical information from previous trials. As the trial
progresses, the Bayesian model updates the predicted probability of
successful completion of the trial on time with the recommended number
of subjects. The model also allows researchers to assess the probability
of meeting a "fallback" option which lengthens the trial duration,
decreases the proposed sample size, or possibly both.

We're currently seeking NIH funding to extend the Bayesian model and to
write accessible and easy to use software for accrual that can run on a
website, a stand-alone computer, or a smartphone/tablet.
