I'm helping out with a beginner's R workshop and I might say a few words
at the beginning about what I like about R. There are three big things,
really.

<!---More--->

First, I like how you manipulate output in R using the same tools that
you manipulate data. So if you wanted to round the values in an ANOVA
table, you use the same function that you would use to round values in
your data set.

Second, you have a lot of control over graphics output in R. You can
control the size of the graph and the size of the margins of the graph,
the values that you place on the axes and where you place the axes
themselves, the size and colors ofÂ  symbols on your graph, and many many
more details.

Third, you get access to some of the most current statistical methods
with R. Most graduate students in Statistics want to see their new
methods used, and they do this by writing user contributed libraries in
R as part of their dissertation. It takes a while for programs like SAS
to get someone internally to program these methods.
