This article talks about git, a version control system for computer
programmers, and how it can be used by researchers to improve the
ability of others to understand and to reproduce your
research.

Ram K. Git can facilitate greater reproducibility and increased
transparency in science. Source Code for Biology and Medicine.
2013;8(1):7. Abstract: "Background:  Reproducibility is the hallmark of
good science. Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific
reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within
the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of
new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications
is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data
deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite
this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or
build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access
to a more complete workflow. Findings:  Version control systems (VCS),
which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software
industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open
source VCS, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is
ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets,
statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual
researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions,
retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while
maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git
and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work
asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while
maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an
overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be
leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new
collaborations, and support novel uses. Keywords: Reproducible research;
Version control; Open science." doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7. Available at:
