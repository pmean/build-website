I took a couple of weeks off from everything work related, including
this blog. I'm back today. My goal in 2014 is to try to post about 6
entries per week on this blog, with roughly 1/3 being original content
and 2/3 being recommended resources. I may lower the average number of
blog entries as the year progresses, but I want to be consistent in the
number of entries from week to week (exlcuding vacations, of course).

I also have an email newsletter and I plan to send out monthly issues,
except possibly in December, which is always way too busy. If you
haven't done so already, here's [the page you can go to so that you can
subscribe to the newsletter](http://www.pmean.com/news/).

I'll be posting less on [my web page](http://www.pmean.com/index.html),
but might still put some longer items there or items that require
regular updates. I plan to eventually (it may take several years) move
all my content to this blog.
