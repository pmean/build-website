The American Statistical Association and the Mathematical Association of
America published a joint statement on the qualifications that a college
teacher would need in order to teach an introductory statistics course
for undergraduate students. This is an issue in many Mathematics
Departments which might need to teach such a class but would not be big
enough to have a degreed Statistician. A minimum amount of course work
is needed, but also practical experience with data analysis, which might
come from "advanced courses, projects, consulting, or
research."
