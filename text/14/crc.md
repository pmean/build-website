Dear Professor Mean, I run a clinic and have a company interested in
having my patients participate in a clinical trial. They tell me that I
need to have a clinical research coordinator. What is that, exactly, and
how much would it cost?

<!---More--->

A clinical research coordinator (CRC) is a person who provides much of
the day-to-day operations in a clinical trial. The background needed for
a CRC is highly dependent on the type of clinical trial(s) that you will
be running. In general, a CRC needs

1.  to have some experience with interacting with patients in a health
    care setting,
2.  to understand human subjects protections regulations, and
3.  to be comfortable with data entry and data management.

If you are expecting to run only a few clinical trials, then you might
be able to train one of your existing staff members to take on the role
of a CRC. It's a great career move for the right person. You'd have to
get them some additional training and give them release time from some
of their current responsibilities. You should also consider offering
them an increase in salary to reflect their greater responsibilities.
All of this takes money. Some of this will be covered by the payments
you will receive from company asking for your help on the clinical
trial, but you might have to ask around for additional funding. Many
health care organizations see participation in clinical trials as an
important strategic goal and are often willing to support efforts like
yours.

What sort of training would you need to get someone to work as a CRC?
They need to have a strong working knowledge of the health care system,
familiarity with medical terminology, and experience interacting with
patients. Almost anyone working in your office, of course, will already
have this.

They also need to understand all the regulations affecting research in
general and clinical trials in particular. These would include

1.  human subjects protections encompassed in the Belmont report, and
    the Declaration of Helsinki,
2.  privacy protections provided by the Health Information Portability
    and Accountability Act,
3.  the role of Institutional Review Boards in reviewing and monitoring
    research studies,
4.  good clinical practice, as defined by the International Conference
    on Harmonization,
5.  management of conflicts of interest.

If your health care organization is already active in research, much of
this training may already be available for the person you want to take
over CRC responsibilities. Given their deep involvement with the conduct
of a clinical trial, you may wish to get additional training above and
beyond what is required for other researchers.

On top of all this, a CRC must understand how to use case report forms.
This may involve abstracting information from the electronic health
record and entry of data into computerized databases systems like
REDCap.

Many research studies get audited, and the CRC will be heavily involved
with these audits. The CRC needs to know how to document his/her work to
withstand such an audit.

The CRC should also be familiar with billing and contracting issues.
Depending on what your clinic does, the CRC may need to understand the
proper handling of hazardous materials and potentially infectious bodily
fluids.

Instead of training someone already in your clinic, you might want to
consider hiring someone from the outside. The cost of the new hire could
be shared among several clinics like yours, because it would take a
large number of clinical trials to justify a full-time CRC. Whichever
way you go, you may want to work with groups like the Association of
Clinical Research Professionals to better understand what a CRC needs.

ONE FINAL WARNING!!! The [job responsibilities of a
CRC](https://research.wustl.edu/Resources/Roles/Pages/CRC.aspx) are
broad and diverse, so don't try this without allocating the proper
amount of resources to do the job well. Keep in mind that poor quality
work done by an undertrained or unqualified CRC could leave you and your
clinic liable to civil and criminal penalties (e.g., through violations
of patient privacy). This is not an area you want to skimp in.
