This study is (sadly) not available for free on the Internet
- but it is
still worth highlighting here. Steven Julious provides some
justification for the use of twelve patients per group in a pilot study.
This is a useful starting point for discussion
- and it may serve as a
useful lower bound. I would suggest that you consider the size of the
larger trial that you are piloting. For a larger study that might
require thousands or tens of thousands of patients
- a pilot study of 12
patients per group is woefully inadequate.
