This study is (sadly) not available for free on the Internet, but it is
still worth highlighting here. Steven Julious provides some
justification for the use of twelve patients per group in a pilot study.
This is a useful starting point for discussion, and it may serve as a
useful lower bound. I would suggest that you consider the size of the
larger trial that you are piloting. For a larger study that might
require thousands or tens of thousands of patients, a pilot study of 12
patients per group is woefully inadequate.
