In an [earlier post][sim3], I had recommended the Statistics Attitude Survey. There is a very similar survey available, The Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics (SATS), created by Candace Schau.

<!---More--->

Schau C. SATS background. Excerpt: "We developed the SATS to help us understand these attitudes and how they impact teaching and learning. The SATS has two major uses. The first use is to help instructors evaluate their students' attitudes toward statistics at the beginning and at the end of their statistics courses. The second is for educational research into students' statistics attitudes." Available in [html format][sat1].

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [blog][sim2].
