This page is obsolete (it refers to a version of my website developed under WordPress). I am keeping it around for sentimental reasons.

<!---more--->

I have been getting nothing but spam under the comments feature of WordPress. I'll keep the comments feature off unless I hear something from you. Send me email by going to my [contact page][sim3], if you have a comment that you'd like to make.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [blog][sim2].
