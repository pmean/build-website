Dennis Roberts has a webpage with several attitude scales that have been
published in the peer-reviewed literature. The fifth one on the list is
a Statistics Attitude Scale, first published in 1980. It has questions
like "1. Statistics will be useful to me in my profession when I
evaluate other people. 2. It takes me a long time to understand a
statistical concept." but Dennis especially highlighted question 18:
"The thought of taking another statistics course makes me sick."
Hah!
