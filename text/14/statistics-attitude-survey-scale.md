Dennis Roberts has a webpage with several attitude scales that have been published in the peer-reviewed literature. The fifth one on the list is a Statistics Attitude Scale, first published in 1980. It has questions like "1. Statistics will be useful to me in my profession when I evaluate other people. 2. It takes me a long time to understand a statistical concept." but Dennis especially highlighted question 18: "The thought of taking another statistics course makes me sick." Hah!
