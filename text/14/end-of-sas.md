This is a provocative title but the actual blog post itself is far more
nuanced. By several measures, R is becoming more and more popular, but
that hardly means that SAS or SPSS will disappear anytime soon. And even
though I disagree with some of the methodology, the author, Bob
Muenchen, deserves lots of credit for backing up his comments with
empirical data. The thing about most statisticians, is that when they
aren't doing stuff for other people, they are just as prone to relying
on anecdotal data.
