The July 2014 issue of Health Affairs is devoted entirely to "big
data".Â  The articles provide a general overview to big data, several
applications of big data, big data and genomics, use of electronic
health records, and ethical issues including privacy concerns. For now,
at least, the articles are available for free to any user.
