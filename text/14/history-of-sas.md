I'm helping to put together three separate classes, Basic data
management and analysis with R \[SAS / SPSS\]. As part of these classes,
I need to discuss the history of these programs, because understanding
that history will help you better understand the strengths and
weaknesses of each statistical package. Here's a brief history
of<U+00A0>SAS.

<!---More--->

SAS, an acronym for Statistical Analysis System, was developed by in the
1960's by Anthony Barr, James Goodnight, Jane Helwig, and John Sall at
North Carolina State University. The original program development was
funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health. In 1976, a
privately held software company, SAS Institute was formed to further
develop the SAS program. Today, SAS Institute is the largest privately
held software corporation. It employs over 13,000 people across six
continents and has revenues of 3 billion U.S. dollars. SAS spends a huge
fraction of its revenues (25% in 2013) on research and development. SAS
Institute is noted for having a family friendly workplace and is
frequently cited as one of the best places to work.

SAS was originally available only on IBM mainframe computers. In 1985,
the millions of lines of SAS code (mostly Pl/1, FORTRAN, and IBM
Assembler) were translated into C so that SAS could be ported to other
computers, but especially to personal computers running Microsoft
Windows.

SAS Institute also sells several other products. JMP, an acronym for
John's Macintosh Product, was developed by John Sall in 1989 for the
Macintosh platform, and was eventually ported to the Windows operating
system as well. JMP is noted for its extensive use of dynamic graphics.
SAS also sells several products for data mining and analysis of genetic
data.

SAS uses a programming language oriented around the DATA step and
various procedures (PROCs) for data analysis. A menu driven version (SAS
Enterprise Manager) is also available.

SAS has a licensing model where you pay a set fee every year for the
ability to use SAS software. It is priced aggressively for large
organizations to encourage its use by many employees, but for individual
independent consultants, the price of SAS is often prohibitive. SAS also
offers a free product on the cloud, SAS OnDemand for Academics. This
product is restricted to teaching uses in an academic environment.

SAS has an extensive set of users manuals which are freely available on
the Internet, and many lavishly supported SAS User Groups and SAS
conferences. SAS also has a publishing arm, SAS Books, with hundreds of
high quality books available. SAS also has a certification program,
described at <http://support.sas.com/certify/index.html>

There aren't that many good resources on the history of the SAS
programming language. Here are a few.
