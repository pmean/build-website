Dean Ornish contributes his response to a series of invited essays on the topic "What Scientific Idea is Ready for Retirement?" His choice is the large randomized controlled trial. While I believe his criticism is too one-sided, he does raise some interesting points about the difficulty in using large trials to assess behavioral interventions.
