Dean Ornish contirbutes his response to a series of invited essays on
the topic "What Scientific Idea is Ready for Retirement?" His choice is
the large randomized controlled trial. While I believe his criticism is
too one-sided, he does raise some interesting points about the
difficulty in using large trials to assess behavioral
interventions.

Ornish D. Edge: What Scientific Idea Is Ready for Retirement--Large
Randomized Controlled Trials. Excerpt: "It is a commonly held but
erroneous belief that a larger study is always more rigorous or
definitive than a smaller one, and a randomized controlled trial is
always the gold standard . However, there is a growing awareness that
size does not always matter and a randomized controlled trial may
introduce its own biases. We need more creative experimental designs."
