Because statistics has too often been presented as a bag of specialized
computational tools, with morbid emphasis on calculation, it is no
wonder that survivors of such courses regard their statistical tools as
instruments of torture \[rather\] than as diagnostic aids in the art and
science of data analysis. --- George W. Cobb, as cited at
