Because statistics has too often been presented as a bag of specialized computational tools, with morbid emphasis on calculation, it is no wonder that survivors of such courses regard their statistical tools as instruments of torture \[rather\] than as diagnostic aids in the art and science of data analysis. --- George W. Cobb, as cited [here][sac1].
