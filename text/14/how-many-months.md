I got a question that I had never heard before, and it sort of is a
statistics question and sort of isn't. A researcher was comparing two
methods of training residents in a particular surgical procedure and
wanted to know how long you should wait between the training and the
evaluation of whether that training was effective.

It's hard to imagine how to turn this into a quantitative question. If
there is reliable data on outcomes across a wide range of time
intervals, then perhaps you can look to see if there is a threshold. If
effectiveness levels off after three months and does not change much
after that, it's hard to justify the extra time, trouble, and expense of
a two year study. But if there is already a wide range of time
intervals, that probably means that your problem has already been
studied to death. So the question of how many months to wait before
re-testing is usually a question that you can only answer with
qualitative data.

Looking at things more broadly than educational interventions, there is
a general rule that long term outcome measures are preferred to short
term outcome measures. The amount of weight you lose after a month on a
particular diet is not that important because most people will
eventually gain back what they lost in the short term. A much better
measure of a diet's success is how much weight people can keep off after
a year on the diet.

A study of smoking cessation education materials showed that most of the
lessons learned by teenagers were forgotten after four months. The two
things that the teens did remember was how expensive a smoking habit
really is and how smoking turns your teeth yellow, which isn't too
surprising. The two issues that teenagers worry a lot about are
appearance and money. All the other important points about why you
shouldn't smoke weren't effectively conveyed because the teens only
remembered them for a short period of time.

In general, interventions are only successful if they "stick" for the
long term. So when you think about when to evaluate the residents, the
longer the time frame, the better. But there's a competing concern. You
need to finish your study in a reasonably narrow time frame. It gets a
lot harder to evaluate the surgical skill of a resident once they've
left your program. You may have other constraints as well. Waiting a
full year before re-testing makes no sense if you've made a commitment
to present your results at the summer research conference.

Sometimes there are certain time thresholds that you cross that are
meaningful. For most cancers, for example, if you can stay in remission
for five years, you are considered to be cured of that cancer.

When your considerations are largely qualitative, the opinions of your
peers is important. They're the ones who are most in tune with the
standards of research in your field, and they should be able to tell you
how long a time frame you need to make your research persuasive.
