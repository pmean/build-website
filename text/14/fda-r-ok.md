This blog post reviews a presentation by Jae Brodowsky, a statistician
with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that put to bed the rumor
that FDA will only accept submissions where the data analysis was done
by SAS. The summary does mention that FDA has certain regulatory
requirements for R (or any other statistical package, including
SAS).
