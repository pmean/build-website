Someone asked what you should do if you get a request to compute a
p-value on a post hoc analysis. In general, any statistic computed on a
post hoc analysis is likely to be biased, but a p-value is especially
troublesome as it is much more prone to misuse or misinterpretation.
Should you refuse to calculate this p-value? Here's what I
said.

As I get older, I get more mellow about things like this. Calculate the
p-value and then warn the client to be sure to mention in any report or
publication that the hypothesis was generated post hoc. Stress that
failure to state that this was a post hoc hypothesis leaves him/her open
to a charge of fraud. Be sure that your client knows and appreciates
that anything that mentions your name without your prior review also
constitutes fraud.

The sin in research is not in publishing something with lots of
limitations. The sin is in pretending that it is something more than it
really is. As long as the report clearly states the post hoc nature of
the hypothesis and discusses the limitations associated with it, you
should be fine. Use phrases like "this is an exploratory effort" or "the
results need to be verified in a separate data set" or whatever. Some
naive people will ignore your limitations, but if we all refused to
publish articles that might be misinterpreted by naive people who ignore
limitations, nothing would get published.

If you find out after the fact that something was published with your
name on it and without you reviewing it, you have plenty of options to
pursue. Write to the journal and talk to the ethics or compliance
officer at the place where your client works.

I'd only turn down the work if you thought this person was a loose
cannon who wouldn't mind getting in trouble with everyone involved in
the process. Most people are comfortable with reasonable requests to
review things. Most people will also respect your request to leave your
name out if you can't agree on appropriate language in the report.
