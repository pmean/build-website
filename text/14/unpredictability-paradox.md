This is a commentary on a 2011 Cochrane Review that found substantial
differences between studies that were adequately randomized and those
that were not adequately randomized. The direction of the difference was
not predictable
- however
- meaning that there was not a consistent bias
on average towards overstating the treatment effect or a consistent bias
on average towards understating the treatment effect. This leads the
authors of the Cochrane review to conclude that "the unpredictability of
random allocation is the best protection against the unpredictability of
the extent to which non-randomised studies may be biased." The authors
of the commentary provide a critique of this conclusion on several
grounds.
