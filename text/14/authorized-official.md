Writing your own grant is an exercise in crisis management. I had a last
minute crisis this afternoon, because I had to fill out a form on very
short notice. One piece of information I needed for the form was the
name of the "authorized official" at Kansas University Medical Center
(KUMC). I didn't even know what an authorized official does. It took a
quick google search, but here is the information, in case I need to
write another grant.

Anytime you are involved with a grant, there is a lot of paperwork
needed in addition to the grant itself. The paperwork varies depending
on the agency that is doing the funding, but let's focus on the grants
funded by the U.S. National Institutes for Health.

If you are [key
personnel](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/senior_key_personnel_faqs.htm),
you need to fill out a [biographical
sketch](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/biosketchsample.pdf).
You are also required to fill outï¿½ a financial conflict of interest
disclosure form to document that you have taken and passed appropriate
training on the ethical conduct of research. These last two requirements
vary from organization to organization.

But the Principal Investigator has to fill out even more paperwork. In
this particular example, I was a Principal Investigator (PI) along with
a colleague at KUMC. With two PIs, you have a choice, and we chose to
make KUMC the lead institution and they would subcontract with the
University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) for my work and the work of a
programmer also at UMKC. The paperwork for designating UMKC as a
subcontractor required us to know the name of the authorized official at
KUMC.

An authorized official is a person who has the authority to legally bind
the organization to the contractual requirements associated with a
research grant. NIH refers to this person as an [authorized organization
representative](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#AuthorizedOrganizationRepresentative%28AOR%29)
and notes that this person is often the same as the [institutional
business
official](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#InstitutionalBusinessOfficial)
and the [signing
official](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#SigningOfficial%28SO%29).
This person is typically in the department associated with research
support and is often the head of that department.

For KUMC, that person is Paul Terranova, and you can find this out by
going to the PDF file titled "[Information Often Requested on Extramural
Funding
Applications.](https://www2.kumc.edu/PDFATraining/Admin/documents/MeiShya%25201.25.08%2520Useful%2520information.pdf)"
By the way, the person with the same job at UMKC is Lawrence Dreyfus and
you can find that out by going to the [institutional information page of
the Office of Research
Support](http://ors.umkc.edu/ors-research-resources/institutional-information).

Now I know that this is rather boring, but I write this stuff down for
my own future reference, as I will not remember any of this the next
time I write a grant.
