In an [earlier post][sim3], I had recommended
the Statistics Attitude Survey. There is a very similar survey
available, The Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics (SATS), created by
Candace Schau.

Schau C. SATS background. Excerpt: "We developed the SATS to help us
understand these attitudes and how they impact teaching and learning.
The SATS has two major uses. The first use is to help instructors
evaluate their students' attitudes toward statistics at the beginning
and at the end of their statistics courses. The second is for
educational research into students' statistics attitudes." Available at:
