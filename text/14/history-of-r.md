I'm helping to put together three separate classes, Basic data management and analysis with R, SAS, SPSS. As part of these classes, I need to discuss the history of these programs, because understanding that history will help you better understand the strengths and weaknesses of each statistical package. Here's a brief history of R.

### R sprouted from S

![Figure 1. Book cover](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/14/history-of-r-book-1984.jpg)

<div class="notes">

R has its roots in a program called S. S was developed in a time when single letters were in vogue (as in the C programming language).

### John Chambers

<div class="notes">

The primary author of the S language was John Chambers. Often he gets sole credit, there were two other major contributors.

### Richard Becker

<div class="notes">

Also involved with S, is another statistician, Richard Becker.

### Bell Labs

<div class="notes">

All three statisticians worked at Bell Labs. Bell Labs was a research division of AT&T (affectionately known as Ma Bell), back when Ma Bell held a monopoly over telephone service.

### Features of S.

+ Intended for internal use.
+ Freely available to anyone.
+ Interactive
+ Unique capabilities
  + Emphasis on functions
  + Object-oriented features

<div class="notes">

The author of S, John Chambers, was a statistician at Bell Laboratories wrote several versions in the 1970s through the 1990s. This packages was intended for internal research use, but the code was freely available to anyone who was interested.

S was an interactive programming language, which made it quite different from other statistical software systems of the times, like SAS and SPSS.

Two unique features of the S programming language were the use of functions rather than macros for extending the language and the introduction of object oriented features (classes, objects, and methods).

### S-plus

<div class="notes">

A commercial adaptation of S was introduced by Statistical Sciences Corporation in the 1990s and became very popular. Through various mergers and buyouts, S+ has been marketed by Mathsoft, Insightful Software, and more recently Tibco Corporation.

### Beginnings of R (1/2)

![Figure 7. Excerpt from research paper](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/14/history-of-r-ihaka-1996.png)

<div class="notes">

About the same time, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman started an effort to produce an open source and freely distributed version of S, called R. Their publication:

Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman. R: A language for data analysis and graphics. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 5(3):299-314, 1996. Available in [pdf format][iha1].

[iha1]: https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/R-paper.pdf

outlined the features of the R programming language.

### Beginnings of R (2/2)

![Figure 8. CD of release 1.0 of R](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/14/history-of-r-cd.png)

<div class="notes">

The first major release of R (version 1.0.0) appeared in 2000.

</div>

### Growth in popularity

![Figure 9. Excerpt from New York Times article](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/14/history-of-r-nytimes-2009.png)

<div class="notes">

Soon R eclipsed S+ in popularity. One measure of the breadth of R's impact was a New York Times article published in 2009.

Ashlee Vance. Data Analysts Captivated by R's Power. The New York Times, 2009-01-06. Available in [html format][van1].

### R Foundation

![Figure 10. Excerpt from website](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/14/history-of-r-foundation-page.png)

<div class="notes">

There is a non-profit group, the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, that coordinates many of the efforts in the maintenance and development of the R programming language.

</div>

### Revolution Analytics

![Figure 11. Excerpt from article](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/14/history-of-r-revolution-analytics.png)

<div class="notes">

Several commercial companies have piggybacked on R, including Revolution Analytics, which sells an enhanced version of R with capabilities for handling very large data sets.

### R packages

![Figure 12. Excerpt from website](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/14/history-of-r-packages.png)

<div class="notes">

One of the most popular features of R is the ease with which outside developers can extend the R language through libraries. Most of these libraries are available for free under and open source license at the [Comprehensive R Archive Network][cra1].

### Bioconductor

<div class="notes">

You can also find a major effort to develop freely available libraries for statistical analysis of genetic data through the [Bioconductor project][bio1].

### Menu driven version of R

Figure 14. Excerpt from website

R is an interactive programming language, but menu driven versions of R are available. The most notable of these is [R Commander][rco1]
