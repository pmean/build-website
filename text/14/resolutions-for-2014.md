I took a couple of weeks off from everything work related, including this blog. I'm back today. My goal in 2014 is to try to post about 6 entries per week on this blog, with roughly 1/3 being original content and 2/3 being recommended resources. I may lower the average number of blog entries as the year progresses, but I want to be consistent in the number of entries from week to week (exlcuding vacations, of course).

I also have an email newsletter and I plan to send out monthly issues, except possibly in December, which is always way too busy. If you haven't done so already, here's the page you can go to so that you can subscribe to the newsletter. 

Note 2024-05-30: I no longer publish a newsletter. I'd like to start again, but I'm not sure when.

I'll be posting less on [my web page][sim3], but might still put some longer items there or items that require regular updates. I plan to eventually (it may take several years) move all my content to this blog.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [blog][sim2].
