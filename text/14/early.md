This blog entry notes how easy it is to fool yourself into thinking that
a screening program is doing well because it finds problems "early while
you still have a chance." It outlines problems with non-randomized
studies that are prone to selection bias, length bias, and lead-time
bias. It also explains what these biases mean in non-technical
language.

Bastian H. "What's so good about "early," anyway?" Statistically funny
blog. 2013 (December 29). Excerpt: "The "get in early!" assumption has
an in-built tendency to lead us astray when it comes to detection of
diseases and conditions. And even most physicians -- just the people we
often rely on to inform us -- don't understand enough about the pitfalls
that lead us to jump to conclusions about early detection too,
well...early." Available at:
