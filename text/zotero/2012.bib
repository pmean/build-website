	abstract = {Personality traits have been shown to interact with environmental cues to modulate biological responses including treatment responses, and potentially having a role in the formation of placebo effects. Here, we assessed psychological traits in 50 healthy controls as to their capacity to predict placebo analgesic effects, placebo-induced activation of μ-opioid neurotransmission and changes in cortisol plasma levels during a sustained experimental pain challenge (hypertonic saline infused in the masseter muscle) with and without placebo administration. Statistical analyses showed that an aggregate of scores from Ego-Resiliency, {NEO} Altruism, {NEO} Straightforwardness (positive predictors) and {NEO} Angry Hostility (negative predictor) scales accounted for 25\% of the variance in placebo analgesic responses. Molecular imaging showed that subjects scoring above the median in a composite of those trait measures also presented greater placebo-induced activation of μ-opioid neurotransmission in the subgenual and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}), orbitofrontal cortex, insula, nucleus accumbens, amygdala and periaqueductal gray ({PAG}). Endogenous opioid release in the dorsal {ACC} and {PAG} was positively correlated with placebo-induced reductions in pain ratings. Significant reductions in cortisol levels were observed during placebo administration and were positively correlated with decreases in pain ratings, μ-opioid system activation in the dorsal {ACC} and {PAG}, and as a trend, negatively with {NEO} Angry Hostility scores. Our results show that personality traits explain a substantial proportion of the variance in placebo analgesic responses and are further associated with activations in endogenous opioid neurotransmission, and as a trend cortisol plasma levels. This initial data, if replicated in larger sample, suggest that simple trait measures easily deployable in the field could be utilized to reduce variability in clinical trials, but may also point to measures of individual resiliency in the face of aversive stimuli such as persistent pain and potentially other stressors.},

	abstract = {Background: A number of studies have been published presenting simulation models of the patient recruitment process. Patient accrual may be viewed in the context of the key components of the trial: study start-up, enrollment, patient stratification, globalization, and so on. Whereas previous research has tended to focus on the mechanics of the simulation models, we have focused on the key components of a clinical study and how to model each of the components.
Methods: We modeled study start-up and patient enrollment processes using cumulative normal distribution functions for study start-up and mean cumulative functions to model cumulative enrollment per active site. The cost function was specified in terms of project time, number of sites and number of patients. We showed how the resulting time-cost model may be influenced by central institutional review boards, patient stratification, and the global distribution of sites. The model was fit to actual study performance data incorporating these factors. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore trade-offs between project time and cost. Decision parameters included the number of sites, which regions of the world to include, the mix of sites by region of the world, the relative size of various patient strata, mean cumulative enrollment rates, and so on.
Mean and variance of the time to complete study start-up was sharply reduced for the set of sites using central institutional review boards in an outpatient cardiovascular trial. Patient stratification tends to prolong the trial and reduce the overall mean cumulative enrollment rates per active site. Mean enrollment rates tend to decline as strata fill up that are simpler to recruit into, and the total project time is prolonged. Including sites in Eastern Europe, South America, and India may increase mean relative enrollment rates by as much as three times the {US} rate and reduce total project time accordingly. Adding sites may reduce project time while adding only marginally to costs, because reductions in time-based costs offset additions in site-based costs. Monte Carlo simulation of the model enables probability statements regarding study completion time.
Conclusion: time-cost models that reflect the complexity and idiosyncrasies of specific trials are critical to prudent planning for individual trials and clinical development plans. Given the formidable challenges in attracting funding for novel drugs and devices, time-cost models have an important role to play in planning and managing global clinical trials.},

One model allows for slow accrual at the start of the study, which eventually reaches a threshold. A simpler model assumes a constant rate of accrual. A comparison has been attempted but we wish to point out some important considerations when comparing these two models. In fact, we can examine the reasonableness of a constant accrual assumption (simpler model) which had data 239 days into a three- year study. We can now update that and report accumulated from the full three years of accrual data and we can demonstrate that constant accrual rate assumption was met in this particular study.

A majority of the respondents were satisfied with participation and would be willing to participate in a future clinical trial. Most negative experiences included transportation to and from the clinic and frequent staff changes. A significant number of the patients reported changes in their smoking habits, alcohol intake, and diet despite the absence of behavioral interventions in the study protocol. There were minor differences between attitudes and perceptions of the male and female participants. No differences were found between patients who had previously participated in a clinical trial and those who had not.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

The conduct of underpowered randomized controlled trials ({RCT}) has recently been criticized in medical journals. We investigated the current prevalence of underpowered {RCT} in rheumatology.


{METHODS}

We searched to identify randomized, prospective {RCT} assessing clinical efficacy of treatments for adult rheumatic diseases published in English in 2001 and 2002. {RCT} were assessed as positive or negative based on the result of the primary outcome measure. For phase {III} {RCT} with negative results without power analysis, we calculated adequate sample size using beta = 0.20 and alpha = 0.05. We also examined trial quality by assessing the adequacy of reported random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and analysis, and compared the quality of reporting of {RCT} with adequate and inadequate sample size.


{RESULTS}

A total of 228 {RCT} met inclusion criteria; of the 205 phase {III} trials, 119 were positive, 81 were negative. The remaining 5 trials made no statistical comparison between interventions, and did not supply enough information for a result to be calculated. Of the 86 negative or indeterminate {RCT}, 37 reported sample size calculations (all but 4 had adequate power). Of the 49 remaining phase {III} trials that did not report power calculations, we conducted sample size calculations; only 10 were adequately powered. Few of the underpowered {RCT} studied rare rheumatic diseases. Negative {RCT} with inadequate sample size were less likely to describe adequate random sequence generation or allocation concealment than positive {RCT} or negative {RCT} with adequate sample size.


{CONCLUSION}

The conduct of underpowered trials is not an infrequent occurrence in rheumatology, with only 50\% of negative or indeterminate phase {III} rheumatology {RCT} in 2001-2002 having adequate sample size.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

To investigate the prevalence of underpowered randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology ({ASCO}) annual meetings.


{METHODS}

We surveyed all two-arm phase {III} {RCTs} presented at {ASCO} annual meetings from 1995 to 2003 for which negative results were obtained. Post hoc calculations were performed using a power of 80\% and an alpha level of .05 (two sided) to determine sample sizes required to detect small, medium, and large effect sizes. For studies reporting a proportion or time-to-event as primary end point, effect size was expressed as an odds ratio ({OR}) or hazard ratio ({HR}), respectively, with a small effect size defined as {OR}/{HR} {\textgreater}or= 1.3, medium effect size defined as {OR}/{HR} {\textgreater}or= 1.5, and large effect size defined as {OR}/{HR} {\textgreater}or= 2.0. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with lack of statistical power.


{RESULTS}

Of 423 negative {RCTs} for which post hoc sample size calculations could be performed, 45 (10.6\%), 138 (32.6\%), and 233 (55.1\%) had adequate sample size to detect small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively. Only 35 negative {RCTs} (7.1\%) reported a reason for inadequate sample size. In a multivariable model, studies that were presented at oral sessions (P = .0038), multicenter studies supported by a cooperative group (P {\textless} .0001), and studies with time to event as primary outcome (P {\textless} .0001) were more likely to have adequate sample size.


{CONCLUSION}

More than half of negative {RCTs} presented at {ASCO} annual meetings do not have an adequate sample to detect a medium-size treatment effect.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

Negative studies provide valuable information. However, conducting studies with inadequate power is unethical and an inefficient use of resources. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of negative studies with inadequate power in urological literature.


{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

The Journal of Urology, Urology and {BJU} International (formerly British Journal of Urology) from 1982 to 2002 were searched using the Ovid {MEDLINE} database. All clinical trials that contained the phrase "no difference" were identified. Data necessary for power calculation were extracted from applicable studies.


{RESULTS}

Of the 417 articles identified in the {MEDLINE} search, 127 were negative studies that contained enough information to be analyzed. There were 70 (55\%) articles from The Journal of Urology, 35 (28\%) from {BJU} International and 22 (17\%) from Urology. Of the studies that used continuous variables 65\% had adequate power (greater than 80\%) to detect a 50\% difference between groups and 32\% had adequate power to detect a 25\% difference. Of the studies that used dichotomous variables only 33\% had adequate power to detect a 50\% difference between groups and 23\% had adequate power to detect a 25\% difference. Levels of adequate power in negative studies did not improve over time (p = 0.258).


{CONCLUSIONS}

Many negative studies in urological literature are inconclusive because they lack adequate power to detect even large differences between groups. Inadequately powered studies often result in false conclusions that alter clinical behavior and deter further research. Therefore, it is imperative to consider power when interpreting literature. When designing future investigations power calculations should be performed to ensure sufficient patient recruitment to attain clinically meaningful results.},

	abstract = {Summary 
Proper randomisation means little if investigators cannot include all randomised participants in the primary analysis. Participants might ignore follow-up, leave town, or take aspartame when instructed to take aspirin. Exclusions before randomisation do not bias the treatment comparison, but they can hurt generalisability. Eligibility criteria for a trial should be clear, specific, and applied before randomisation. Readers should assess whether any of the criteria make the trial sample atypical or unrepresentative of the people in which they are interested. In principle, assessment of exclusions after randomisation is simple: none are allowed. For the primary analysis, all participants enrolled should be included and analysed as part of the original group assigned (an intent-to-treat analysis). In reality, however, losses frequently occur. Investigators should, therefore, commit adequate resources to develop and implement procedures to maximise retention of participants. Moreover, researchers should provide clear, explicit information on the progress of all randomised participants through the trial by use of, for instance, a trial profile. Investigators can also do secondary analyses on, for instance, per-protocol or as-treated participants. Such analyses should be described as secondary and non-randomised comparisons. Mishandling of exclusions causes serious methodological difficulties. Unfortunately, some explanations for mishandling exclusions intuitively appeal to readers, disguising the seriousness of the issues. Creative mismanagement of exclusions can undermine trial validity.},

Only one study used confidence intervals to describe the main findings, and only three studies (7\%) mentioned the basis for sample size estimation at the outset of the study. Of particular concern was that in half (23/44) of the studies there was an incorrect interpretation of the findings.It is worrying to observe such a profusion of clinical trials in dermatology which are too small to answer the questions being posed, especially when this is coupled with misreporting of results. Apart from ethical concerns, many treatments compatible with a considerable treatment benefit may have been erroneously discarded as a result of such studies.We recommend the use of confidence intervals to summarize clinical trial findings, so that readers can quickly decide whether clinically important treatment effects are plausible.},

Optimism bias refers to unwarranted belief in the efficacy of new therapies. We assessed the impact of optimism bias on a proportion of trials that did not answer their research question successfully and explored whether poor accrual or optimism bias is responsible for inconclusive results.


{STUDY} {DESIGN}

Systematic review.


{SETTING}

Retrospective analysis of a consecutive-series phase {III} randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) performed under the aegis of National Cancer Institute Cooperative groups.


{RESULTS}

Three hundred fifty-nine trials (374 comparisons) enrolling 150,232 patients were analyzed. Seventy percent (262 of 374) of the trials generated conclusive results according to the statistical criteria. Investigators made definitive statements related to the treatment preference in 73\% (273 of 374) of studies. Investigators' judgments and statistical inferences were concordant in 75\% (279 of 374) of trials. Investigators consistently overestimated their expected treatment effects but to a significantly larger extent for inconclusive trials. The median ratio of expected and observed hazard ratio or odds ratio was 1.34 (range: 0.19-15.40) in conclusive trials compared with 1.86 (range: 1.09-12.00) in inconclusive studies (P{\textless}0.0001). Only 17\% of the trials had treatment effects that matched original researchers' expectations.


{CONCLUSION}

Formal statistical inference is sufficient to answer the research question in 75\% of {RCTs}. The answers to the other 25\% depend mostly on subjective judgments, which at times are in conflict with statistical inference. Optimism bias significantly contributes to inconclusive results.},

	abstract = {A resilient issue in research ethics is whether and when a placebo-controlled trial ({PCT}) is justified if it deprives research subjects of a recognized treatment. The clinicians' moral duty to provide the best available care seems to require the use of 'active' controlled trials ({ACTs}) that use an established treatment as a control whenever such a therapy is available. In another regard, {ACTs} are supposedly methodologically inferior to {PCTs}. Hence, the moral duty of the clinical researcher to use the best methods will favor {PCTs}. In this target article, I analyze the three reasons for believing that {ACTs} are inferior to {PCTs} namely: 1) {ACTs} lack 'assay sensitivity'; 2) {ACTs} do not measure absolute effect size; and 3) {ACTs} require more participants; and I contend that none are acceptable. Consequently the tension between clinical and research ethics dissolves: the moral duty of the clinician to avoid {PCTs} is unopposed by methodological considerations.},

This permits a statistical regression analysis of the intensity of a recurrent event allowing for complicated censoring patterns and time dependent covariates. Furthermore, this formulation gives rise to proofs with very simple structure using martingale techniques for the asymptotic properties of the estimators from such a model.

The "lasso" minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

The initial selection of papers was then reviewed to confirm that the articles were about {CCTs} and to assess the quality of the studies. Selected journals were also hand searched to identify {CCTs} not retrieved by either database. Overall, 4111 different references were retrieved (2253 for {RA}, 978 for {OP}, and 880 for {LBP}); 3418 (83\%) of the papers were in English. {EMBASE} retrieved 78\% more references than {MEDLINE} (2895 versus 1625). Overall, 1217 (30\%) of the papers were retrieved by both databases. Two hundred forty-three papers were about {CCTs}. Two-thirds of these were retrieved by both databases, and one-third by only one. An additional 16 {CCTs} not retrieved by either database were identified through hand searching. Taking these into account, {EMBASE} retrieved 16\% more {CCTs} than {MEDLINE} (220 versus 188); the {EMBASE} search identified 85\% of the {CCTs} compared to 73\% by {MEDLINE}. No significant differences were observed in the mean quality scores and sample size of the {CCTs} missed by {MEDLINE} compared to those missed by {EMBASE}. Our findings suggest that the use of {MEDLINE} alone to identify {CCTs} is inadequate.

	abstract = {{BackgroundBackground} The proportion of proposed new treatments that are 'successful' is of ethical, scientific, and public importance. We investigated how often new, experimental treatments evaluated in randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) are superior to established treatments. {ObjectivesObjectives} Our main question was: "On average how often are new treatments more effective, equally effective or less effective than established treatments?" Additionally, we wanted to explain the observed results, i.e. whether the observed distribution of outcomes is consistent with the 'uncertainty requirement' for enrollment in {RCTs}. We also investigated the effect of choice of comparator (active versus no treatment/placebo) on the observed results. Search {methodsSearch} methods We searched the Cochrane Methodology Register ({CMR}) 2010, Issue 1 in The Cochrane Library (searched 31 March 2010); {MEDLINE} Ovid 1950 to March Week 2 2010 (searched 24 March 2010); and {EMBASE} Ovid 1980 to 2010 Week 11 (searched 24 March 2010). Selection {criteriaSelection} criteria Cohorts of studies were eligible for the analysis if they met all of the following criteria: (i) consecutive series of {RCTs}, (ii) registered at or before study onset, and (iii) compared new against established treatments in humans. Data collection and {analysisData} collection and analysis {RCTs} from four cohorts of {RCTs} met all inclusion criteria and provided data from 743 {RCTs} involving 297,744 patients. All four cohorts consisted of publicly funded trials. Two cohorts involved evaluations of new treatments in cancer, one in neurological disorders, and one for mixed types of diseases. We employed kernel density estimation, meta-analysis and meta-regression to assess the probability of new treatments being superior to established treatments in their effect on primary outcomes and overall survival. Main {resultsMain} results The distribution of effects seen was generally symmetrical in the size of difference between new versus established treatments. Meta-analytic pooling indicated that, on average, new treatments were slightly more favorable both in terms of their effect on reducing the primary outcomes (hazard ratio ({HR})/odds ratio ({OR}) 0.91, 99\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.88 to 0.95) and improving overall survival ({HR} 0.95, 99\% {CI} 0.92 to 0.98). No heterogeneity was observed in the analysis based on primary outcomes or overall survival (I2 = 0\%). Kernel density analysis was consistent with the meta-analysis, but showed a fairly symmetrical distribution of new versus established treatments indicating unpredictability in the results. This was consistent with the interpretation that new treatments are only slightly superior to established treatments when tested in {RCTs}. Additionally, meta-regression demonstrated that results have remained stable over time and that the success rate of new treatments has not changed over the last half century of clinical trials. The results were not significantly affected by the choice of comparator (active versus placebo/no therapy). Authors' {conclusionsAuthors}' conclusions Society can expect that slightly more than half of new experimental treatments will prove to be better than established treatments when tested in {RCTs}, but few will be substantially better. This is an important finding for patients (as they contemplate participation in {RCTs}), researchers (as they plan design of the new trials), and funders (as they assess the 'return on investment'). Although we provide the current best evidence on the question of expected 'success rate' of new versus established treatments consistent with a priori theoretical predictions reflective of 'uncertainty or equipoise hypothesis', it should be noted that our sample represents less than 1\% of all available randomized trials; therefore, one should exercise the appropriate caution in interpretation of our findings. In addition, our conclusion applies to publicly funded trials only, as we did not include studies funded by commercial sponsors in our analysis.},

	abstract = {Objectives. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnoses of healed myocardial infarction made from the 12-lead electrocardiogram ({ECG}) by artificial neural networks and an experienced electrocardiographer.Background. Artificial neural networks have proved of value in pattern recognition tasks. Studies of their utility in {ECG} interpretation have shown performance exceeding that of conventional {ECG} interpretation programs. The latter present verbal statements, often with an indication of the likelihood for a certain diagnosis, such as “possible left ventricular hypertrophy.” A neural network presents its output as a numeric value between 0 and 1; however, these values can be interpreted as Bayesian probabilities.Methods. The study was based on 351 healthy volunteers and 1,313 patients with a history of chest pain who had undergone diagnostic cardiac catheterization. A 12-lead {ECG} was recorded in each subject. An expert electrocardiographer classified the {ECGs} in five different groups by estimating the probability of anterior myocardial infarction. Artificial neural networks were trained and tested to diagnose anterior myocardial infarction. The network outputs were divided into five groups by using the output values and four thresholds between 0 and 1.Results. The neural networks diagnosed healed anterior myocardial infarctions at high levels of sensitivity and specificity. The network outputs were transformed to verbal statements, and the agreement between these probability estimates and those of an expert electrocardiographer was high.Conclusions. Artificial neural networks can be of value in automated interpretation of {ECGs} in the near future.},
