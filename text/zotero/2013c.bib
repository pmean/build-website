Accumulating results can be assessed at any time, including continually, with the possibility of modifying the design of the trial, for example, by slowing (or stopping) or expanding accrual, imbalancing randomization to favour better-performing therapies, dropping or adding treatment arms, and changing the trial population to focus on patient subsets that are responding better to the experimental therapies. Bayesian analyses use available patient-outcome information, including biomarkers that accumulating data indicate might be related to clinical outcome. They also allow for the use of historical information and for synthesizing results of relevant trials. Here, I explain the rationale underlying Bayesian clinical trials, and discuss the potential of such trials to improve the effectiveness of drug development.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the use of adaptive design methods in clinical research and development based on accrued data has become very popular due to its flexibility and efficiency. Based on adaptations applied, adaptive designs can be classified into three categories: prospective, concurrent (ad hoc), and retrospective adaptive designs. An adaptive design allows modifications made to trial and/or statistical procedures of ongoing clinical trials. However, it is a concern that the actual patient population after the adaptations could deviate from the originally target patient population and consequently the overall type I error (to erroneously claim efficacy for an infective drug) rate may not be controlled. In addition, major adaptations of trial and/or statistical procedures of on-going trials may result in a totally different trial that is unable to address the scientific/medical questions the trial intends to answer. In this article, several commonly considered adaptive designs in clinical trials are reviewed. Impacts of ad hoc adaptations (protocol amendments), challenges in by design (prospective) adaptations, and obstacles of retrospective adaptations are described. Strategies for the use of adaptive design in clinical development of rare diseases are discussed. Some examples concerning the development of Velcade intended for multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are given. Practical issues that are commonly encountered when implementing adaptive design methods in clinical trials are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Patients with mental disorders show many biological abnormalities which distinguish them from normal volunteers; however, few of these have led to tests with clinical utility. Several reasons contribute to this delay: lack of a biological ‘gold standard’ definition of psychiatric illnesses; a profusion of statistically significant, but minimally differentiating, biological findings; ‘approximate replications’ of these findings in a way that neither confirms nor refutes them; and a focus on comparing prototypical patients to healthy controls which generates differentiations with limited clinical applicability. Overcoming these hurdles will require a new approach. Rather than seek biomedical tests that can ‘diagnose’ {DSM}-defined disorders, the field should focus on identifying biologically homogenous subtypes that cut across phenotypic diagnosis—thereby sidestepping the issue of a gold standard. To ensure clinical relevance and applicability, the field needs to focus on clinically meaningful differences between relevant clinical populations, rather than hypothesis-rejection versus normal controls. Validating these new biomarker-defined subtypes will require longitudinal studies with standardized measures which can be shared and compared across studies—thereby overcoming the problem of significance chasing and approximate replications. Such biological tests, and the subtypes they define, will provide a natural basis for a ‘stratified psychiatry’ that will improve clinical outcomes across conventional diagnostic boundaries.},

This paper sought to document the use of {MI} in general medical journals and to evaluate the information provided to readers about the application of the procedure in studies.
{METHODS}: Research articles using {MI} in analyses published in {JAMA}, New England Journal of Medicine, {BMJ} and the Lancet were identified using full text searches from the earliest date each journal offered such searches until the end of 2008. Ninety-nine articles were found. Studies were classified according to their design.
{RESULTS}: Multiple imputation was used in 49 {RCTs} and 50 other types of studies. A third of the articles (n = 33) reported no details of the procedure used. In a third of these (n = 11), it was not possible to infer the approach used from references cited or software used. The nature of the imputation model was rarely reported. {MI} was frequently used as a secondary analysis (n = 40) either to justify reporting a simpler approach or as a form of sensitivity analysis.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Whilst still relatively uncommon, the use of {MI} has risen substantially, particularly in trials. {MI} is rarely adequately reported, leading to doubt about its appropriateness in some cases. This gives rise to uncertainty about conclusions reached and poses a barrier to attempts to replicate analyses. Guidelines for the reporting of {MI} should be developed.},

Frequently used approaches to address these concerns, such as upward adjustments in sample sizes or simplistic methods for handling missing data, including last-observation-carried-forward, complete-case, or worst-case analyses, are usually inadequate. Although rational imputation methods may be useful to treat missingness after it has occurred, these methods depend on untestable assumptions. Thus, the preferred and often only satisfactory approach to addressing missing data is to prevent it. Procedures should be in place to maximize the likelihood that outcome data will be obtained at scheduled times of evaluation for all surviving patients who have not withdrawn consent. To meaningfully reduce missing data, it is important to recognize and address many factors that commonly lead to higher levels of missingness.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The purpose of this study was to identify patient characteristics that may be risk factors or markers of susceptibility to adverse treatment effects in cancer Phase I and {II} clinical trials. Patients and Methods: A total of 459 patients enrolled in 23 therapeutic Phase I and {II} studies at the Fox Chase Cancer Center were included in the analysis. Patient-specific characteristics, medical and treatment history, doses of experimental agents, and graded toxicities were extracted from case report forms. We developed a novel summary measure, the toxicity index ({TI}), to better discriminate patients on the basis of their overall toxicity experiences. Mixed model {ANOVA} was used to model {TI} on the basis of data from all trials using a specific agent. Generalized estimating equations in the context of binary logistic regression were used to model dose-limiting toxicity.
{RESULTS}: Seventeen pretreatment factors, including performance status, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, serum creatinine, and tobacco use, emerged as significant predictors of toxicity as defined by dose-limiting toxicity or {TI}. Unexpectedly, dose was not always a predictor of toxicity. Even for values within the normal range, the {TI} identified serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase as predictors of toxicity after treatment with docetaxel and alkaline phosphatase as a predictor for toxicity after treatment with irinotecan.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Independent of dose, certain pretreatment characteristics, including measures of organ function that are in the normal range, were found to be predictors of treatment toxicity. Because of its sensitivity to differences in overall toxicity, the {TI} should prove to be a useful tool for identifying predictors of chemotherapy-related toxicity.},

Because of the high rate of missing human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) infection status in this dataset, we used multiple imputation methods to minimize the bias that may result from less sophisticated methods.
{METHODS}: We compared analysis based on multiple imputation methods with analysis based on deleting subjects with missing covariate data from regression analysis (case exclusion), and determined whether the use of increasing numbers of imputed datasets would lead to changes in the estimated association between isoniazid resistance and death.
{RESULTS}: Following multiple imputation, the odds ratio for initial isoniazid resistance and death was 2.07 (95\% {CI} 1.30, 3.29); with case exclusion, this odds ratio decreased to 1.53 (95\% {CI} 0.83, 2.83). The use of more than 5 imputed datasets did not substantively change the results.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our experience with the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System dataset supports the use of multiple imputation methods in epidemiologic analysis, but also demonstrates that close attention should be paid to the potential impact of missing covariates at each step of the analysis.},

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called {LARS}-{EN} is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm {LARS} does for the lasso.},

	abstract = {Background Systematic reviews ({SR}) of clinical evidence are rightfully considered the basis for developing recommendations to support decisions in current practice. To avoid bias, {SRs} are expected to be systematic in their research strategy and are exhaustive. The drawback of the latter criteria relies in the substantial work needed to conduct and keep {SRs} updated. The objective of this paper is to compare a research strategy based on the review of a selected number of core journals, which we consider a ‘pragmatic review’ ({PR}), with that derived by an {SR} in estimating the efficacy of treatments. Methods Five clinical areas were considered for the comparison between the two strategies: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dermatology, heart failure, renal diseases and stroke. We extracted a systematic sample from all the Cochrane {SRs} pertaining to each area and were published before April 2010. Two groups of journals were considered in the {PR}: six general journals that commonly published research for the five clinical areas, and five specialist journals with the highest impact factor in each area. To assess the agreement in the findings of {SRs} and {PRs}, we considered both the direction of the estimates and P-values. Results A sample of 27 {SRs} included 171 overall analyses and 259 subgroup analyses related to primary outcomes. The {PR} captured one or more clinical trials in 24 of the 27 {SRs} (89\%), and 118 of the 171 overall analyses (69\%) were replicated. The {PR} supported the recommendations to use (or not) the study treatment in 11 of the 13 {SRs} (85\%), which ended with a clinical recommendation. Conclusions We verified in a sample of {SRs} that the conclusion of a research strategy based on a pre-defined set of general and specialist medical journals is able to replicate almost all the clinical recommendations of a formal {SR}.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundChance} imbalance in baseline prognosis of a randomized controlled trial can lead to over or underestimation of treatment effects, particularly in trials with small sample sizes. Our study aimed to (1) evaluate the probability of imbalance in a binary prognostic factor ({PF}) between two treatment arms, (2) investigate the impact of prognostic imbalance on the estimation of a treatment effect, and (3) examine the effect of sample size (n) in relation to the first two objectives.{MethodsWe} simulated data from parallel-group trials evaluating a binary outcome by varying the risk of the outcome, effect of the treatment, power and prevalence of the {PF}, and n. Logistic regression models with and without adjustment for the {PF} were compared in terms of bias, standard error, coverage of confidence interval and statistical power.{ResultsFor} a {PF} with a prevalence of 0.5, the probability of a difference in the frequency of the {PF}≥5\% reaches 0.42 with 125/arm. Ignoring a strong {PF} (relative risk = 5) leads to underestimating the strength of a moderate treatment effect, and the underestimate is independent of n when n is {\textgreater}50/arm. Adjusting for such {PF} increases statistical power. If the {PF} is weak ({RR} = 2), adjustment makes little difference in statistical inference. Conditional on a 5\% imbalance of a powerful {PF}, adjustment reduces the likelihood of large bias. If an absolute measure of imbalance ≥5\% is deemed important, including 1000 patients/arm provides sufficient protection against such an imbalance. Two thousand patients/arm may provide an adequate control against large random deviations in treatment effect estimation in the presence of a powerful {PF}.{ConclusionsThe} probability of prognostic imbalance in small trials can be substantial. Covariate adjustment improves estimation accuracy and statistical power, and hence should be performed when strong {PFs} are observed.},

I hope I was successful on both accounts.

Guidelines made me feel so happy I could die
I told my patients it was good enough
To lower glucose make them unconscious 
I put my 95 year-olds on a statin

I should have known all along that this was wrong 
100 over 60 made them fall, they really fall 
Stopping salt and fat did not make sense
I really should have looked at evidence
I didn't know that half of guidelines were just opinion

You say I need an {RCT}
One that actually shows a difference in a real outcome  
I'm supposed to know the {NNT}, and discuss it with my patients
Are you kidding me?

Don't know what a p-value is
You say I need a Cochrane review to help me find some numbers
I hear some surrogates were wrong
And now I need some studies I'm supposed to quote

Now I need some studies I'm supposed to quote
Now I need some studies I'm supposed to quote
       
Now and then I think of all the things you had me measure
You had me thinking there was always something that was wrong
All that fibre was an adventure
Now I'm passing wicker furniture
Beta-blockers made me feel real slow
And now you telling me about some studies that you need to quote 

But now I'm reading {RCTs}
You get a 1\% reduction from a low dose statin      
I know now that an A1C of less than 8 is good enough as long as you don't pee
Forget about your {CRP}
Just don't eat like a great fat pig and go get some activity
I think that I can help you now
I finally have some studies that I like to quote

Some studies 
(That I like to quote)
Some studies
(Now I have some studies that I like to quote)

Some studies 
(That I like to quote)
Some studies
(Now I have some studies that I like to quote)

However, there could be certain situations where R, {SPSS}, or Stata may be the preferred software.

	abstract = {Investigators often design clinical trials without knowing precisely the values of such necessary parameters as the variances or the event rates in the control group. In order to determine reasonable values for such parameters, they may design a small pilot study external to the main trial. In this paper we propose designs, which we term internal pilot studies, that designate a portion of the main trial as a pilot phase. At the end of the internal pilot study, the investigators recompute preselected parameters and recalculate required sample size. The study then proceeds with the modifications dictated by the internal pilot. Final analyses of the results incorporate all data, disregarding the fact that part of the data came from a pilot phase. As one example of this type of design, we consider a study to compare two normally distributed means. By simulation, we show a numerical example for which the effect of the procedure on the alpha-level is negligible, but the potential gain in power considerable. We urge considering a similar approach for a number of types of endpoints.},

Failure to publish an adequate account of a well-designed clinical trial is a form of scientific misconduct that can lead those caring for patients to make inappropriate treatment decisions. Investigators, research ethics committees, funding bodies, and scientific editors all have responsibilities to reduce underreporting of clinical trials. An extended use of prospective registration of trials at inception, as well as benefiting clinical research in other ways, could help people to play their respective roles in reducing underreporting of clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate the scientific quality of original research articles on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke; to determine whether poor article quality is associated with publication in non-peer-reviewed symposium proceedings or with other article characteristics.
Design Cross sectional study of original research articles on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke published in peer reviewed journals and non-peer-reviewed symposium proceedings from 1980 to 1994. Article quality was assessed by two independent reviewers who used a valid and reliable instrument, were unaware of study hypotheses, were blinded to identifying characteristics of articles, and had no disclosed conflicts of interest.
Participants All symposium articles (n = 68) and a random sample of peer reviewed journal articles (n = 68) that satisfied inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Main Outcome Measure Mean quality scores, which could range from 0 (lowest quality) to 1 (highest quality).
Results Using multivariate regression analysis, symposium articles were of poorer scientific quality than peer reviewed journal articles when controlling simultaneously for the effects of study design, article conclusion, article topic, and source of funding acknowledged (P = 0.027). Article quality was not associated with either source of funding acknowledged or article conclusion in multivariate analyses.
Conclusions In published reports on environmental tobacco smoke, non-peer-reviewed symposium articles tend to be of poor quality. These articles should not be used in scientific, legal, or policy settings unless their quality has been independently assessed.},
