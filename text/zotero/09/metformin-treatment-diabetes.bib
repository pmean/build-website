	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}:Metformin has had a 'black box' contraindication in diabetic patients with heart failure ({HF}), but many believe it to be the treatment of choice in this setting. Therefore, we attempted to conduct a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of undertaking a large randomized controlled trial with clinical endpoints.{STUDY} {DESIGN}:The pilot study was a randomized double blinded placebo controlled trial. Patients with {HF} and type 2 diabetes were screened in hospitals and {HF} clinics in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (population {textasciitilde}1 million). Major exclusion criteria included the current use of insulin or high dose metformin, decreased renal function, or a glycosylated hemoglobin <7%. Patients were to be randomized to 1500 mg of metformin daily or matching placebo and followed for 6 months for a variety of functional outcomes, as well as clinical events.{RESULTS}:Fifty-eight patients were screened over a six month period and all were excluded. Because of futility with respect to enrollment, the pilot study was abandoned. The mean age of screened patients was 77 ({SD} 9) years and 57% were male. The main reasons for exclusion were: use of insulin therapy (n = 23; 40%), glycosylated hemoglobin <7% (n = 17; 29%) and current use of high dose metformin (n = 12; 21%). Overall, contraindicated metformin therapy was the most commonly prescribed oral antihyperglycemic agent (n = 27; 51%). On average, patients were receiving 1,706 mg ({SD} 488 mg) of metformin daily and 12 (44%) used only metformin.{CONCLUSION}:Despite uncertainty in the scientific literature, there does not appear to be clinical uncertainty with regards to the safety or effectiveness of metformin in {HF} making a definitive randomized trial virtually impossible.{TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}:{ClinicalTrials}.gov Identifier: {NCT}00325910},
