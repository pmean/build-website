	abstract = {Excerpt: "This document applies to research involving coded private information or human biological specimens (hereafter referred to as <U+FFFD>specimens<U+FFFD>) that is conducted or supported by {HHS}. This document does the following: (1) Provides guidance as to when research involving coded private information or specimens is or is not research involving human subjects, as defined under {HHS} regulations for the protection of human research subjects (45 {CFR} part 46). (2) Reaffirms {OHRP} policy (see {OHRP} guidance on repository activities http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/reposit.htm and research on human embryonic stem cells http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/stemcell.pdf) that, under certain limited conditions, research involving only coded private information or specimens is not human subjects research. (3) Clarifies the distinction between (a) research involving coded private information or specimens that does not involve human subjects and (b) human subjects research that is exempt from the requirements of the {HHS} regulations. (4) References pertinent requirements of the {HIPAA} Privacy Rule that may be applicable to research involving coded private information or specimens."},
