	abstract = {Excerpt: "Guideline developers around the world are inconsistent in how they rate quality of evidence and grade strength of recommendations. As a result, guideline users face challenges in understanding the messages that grading systems try to communicate. Since 2006 the {BMJ} has requested in its "Instructions to Authors" on bmj.com that authors should preferably use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ({GRADE}) system for grading evidence when submitting a clinical guidelines article. What was behind this decision? In this first in a series of five articles we will explain why many organisations use formal systems to grade evidence and recommendations and why this is important for clinicians; we will focus on the {GRADE} approach to recommendations. In the next two articles we will examine how the {GRADE} system categorises quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The final two articles will focus on recommendations for diagnostic tests and {GRADE}'s framework for tackling the impact of interventions on use of resources."},
