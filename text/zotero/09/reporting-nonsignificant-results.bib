	abstract = {Excerpt: "Aims: The purpose of the survey was to determine expert views on how to report the results of studies that produced non-significant results. The ultimate aim is to produce agreed guidelines for non-significant results. Method: Respondents were presented with 2 scenarios of studies comparing 2 groups on the proportion of people with high blood pressure. Results were given as proportion in each group with high blood pressure, size of the study and the (non-significant) chi-square. Respondents were first asked for free form text on how the results should be reported to lay and professional audiences. They were then presented with multiple choices for the proportions of respondents with high bop in each group that would be expected in a replication study. Discipline, role, experience and further comments were also elicited."},
