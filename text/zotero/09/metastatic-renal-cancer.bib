	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Treatment for metastatic renal cell cancer ({mRCC}) has advanced dramatically with understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. New treatment options may provide improved progression-free survival ({PFS}). We aimed to determine the relative effectiveness of new therapies in this field. {METHODS}: We conducted comprehensive searches of 11 electronic databases from inception to April 2008. We included randomized trials ({RCTs}) that evaluated bevacizumab, sorafenib, and sunitinib. Two reviewers independently extracted data, in duplicate. Our primary outcome was investigator-assessed {PFS}. We performed random-effects meta-analysis with a mixed treatment comparison analysis. {RESULTS}: We included 3 bevacizumab (2 of bevacizumab plus interferon-a [{IFN}-a]), 2 sorafenib, 1 sunitinib, and 1 temsirolimus trials (total n=3,957). All interventions offer advantages for {PFS}. Using indirect comparisons with interferon-alpha as the common comparator, we found that sunitinib was superior to both sorafenib ({HR} 0.58, 95% {CI}, 0.38-0.86, P=<0.001) and bevacizumab + {IFN}-a ({HR} 0.75, 95% {CI}, 0.60-0.93, P=0.001). Sorafenib was not statistically different from bevacizumab +{IFN}-a in this same indirect comparison analysis ({HR} 0.77, 95% {CI}, 0.52-1.13, P=0.23). Using placebo as the similar comparator, we were unable to display a significant difference between sorafenib and bevacizumab alone ({HR} 0.81, 95% {CI}, 0.58-1.12, P=0.23). Temsirolimus provided significant {PFS} in patients with poor prognosis ({HR} 0.69, 95% {CI}, 0.57-0.85). {CONCLUSIONS}: New interventions for {mRCC} offer a favourable {PFS} for {mRCC} compared to interferon-alpha and placebo."},
