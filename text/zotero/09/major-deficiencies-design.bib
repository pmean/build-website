	abstract = {Excerpt: "Clinical trials are a critical resource for the discovery of new, life-saving drugs and for developing better prevention and diagnostic screening methods. Todayâ€™s most effective prevention and treatment modalities are based on previous clinical trial results. But while the need for clinical research is undisputed, how clinical trials are now conducted remains problematic. Increasing research finds major deficiencies in the way clinical trials are designed, carried out and funded in the U.S. with serious implications for the outcomes of medical research studies. Of key significance for the future of scientific innovation is the exclusion or underrepresentation of women, older people, minorities, disabled persons, and rural populations in the vast majority of the research studies conducted in the U.S. Without adequate representation of all patient populations, researchers cannot learn about potential differences among groups and cannot ensure the generalization of results."},
