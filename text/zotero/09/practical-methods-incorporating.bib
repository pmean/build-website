	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: In systematic reviews and meta-analyses, time-to-event outcomes are most appropriately analysed using hazard ratios ({HRs}). In the absence of individual patient data ({IPD}), methods are available to obtain {HRs} and/or associated statistics by carefully manipulating published or other summary data. Awareness and adoption of these methods is somewhat limited, perhaps because they are published in the statistical literature using statistical notation. {METHODS}: This paper aims to 'translate' the methods for estimating a {HR} and associated statistics from published time-to-event-analyses into less statistical and more practical guidance and provide a corresponding, easy-to-use calculations spreadsheet, to facilitate the computational aspects. {RESULTS}: A wider audience should be able to understand published time-to-event data in individual trial reports and use it more appropriately in meta-analysis. When faced with particular circumstances, readers can refer to the relevant sections of the paper. The spreadsheet can be used to assist them in carrying out the calculations. {CONCLUSION}: The methods cannot circumvent the potential biases associated with relying on published data for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. However, this practical guide should improve the quality of the analysis and subsequent interpretation of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that include time-to-event outcomes.},
