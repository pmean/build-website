	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: The purpose of this study was to validate the accuracy of an alternative cervical cancer test - visual inspection with acetic acid ({VIA}) - by addressing possible imperfections in the gold standard through latent class analysis ({LCA}). The data were originally collected at peri-urban health clinics in Zimbabwe. {METHODS}: Conventional accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) estimates for {VIA} and two other screening tests using colposcopy/biopsy as the reference standard were compared to {LCA} estimates based on results from all four tests. For conventional analysis, negative colposcopy was accepted as a negative outcome when biopsy was not available as the reference standard. With {LCA}, local dependencies between tests were handled through adding direct effect parameters or additional latent classes to the model. {RESULTS}: Two models yielded good fit to the data, a 2-class model with two adjustments and a 3-class model with one adjustment. The definition of latent disease associated with the latter was more stringent, backed by three of the four tests. Under that model, sensitivity for {VIA} (abnormal+) was 0.74 compared to 0.78 with conventional analyses. Specificity was 0.639 versus 0.568, respectively. By contrast, the {LCA}-derived sensitivity for colposcopy/biopsy was 0.63. {CONCLUSION}: {VIA} sensitivity and specificity with the 3-class {LCA} model were within the range of published data and relatively consistent with conventional analyses, thus validating the original assessment of test accuracy. {LCA} probably yielded more likely estimates of the true accuracy than did conventional analysis with in-country colposcopy/biopsy as the reference standard. Colpscopy with biopsy can be problematic as a study reference standard and {LCA} offers the possibility of obtaining estimates adjusted for referent imperfections."},
