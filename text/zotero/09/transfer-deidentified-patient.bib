	abstract = {Excerpt: "Advances in bioinformatics and automated laboratory equipment have made it possible to “mine” very large medical databases and repositories of biological samples for information that will ultimately produce novel therapies. Some physicians and hospitals have noted the
commercial implications of this research and have begun to charge pharmaceutical
companies and biomedical researchers fees for medical data and biological specimens
obtained during patient care. Commercialization of this emerging area of research has made it more important to address issues that relate to the original source of the information and samples: patients and clinical research subjects (in this article, collectively referred to as
“patients”)."},
