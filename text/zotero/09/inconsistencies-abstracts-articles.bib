	abstract = {Excerpt: "The abstract of a research article is considered to be the most important part of the article. It should contain, in a brief but concise form, the critical components of the scientific study being reported. It often is the only part of the article that is read and is widely available through biomedical databases. Thus, it is of fundamental importance that data reported in abstracts are consistent with those reported in the body of the article. Recent studies have reported that data in abstracts sometimes are inconsistent with those reported in the article. The aim of this study was to determine the abstract data inconsistency rate of Clinical Chemistry."},
