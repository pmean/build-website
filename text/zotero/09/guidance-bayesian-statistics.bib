	abstract = {Excerpt: "This document provides guidance on statistical aspects of the design and analysis of clinical trials for medical devices that use Bayesian statistical methods. The purpose of this guidance is to discuss important statistical issues in Bayesian clinical trials for medical devices and not to describe the content of a medical device submission. Further, while this document provides guidance on many of the statistical issues that arise in Bayesian clinical trials, it is not intended to be all-inclusive. The statistical literature is rich with books and papers on Bayesian theory and methods; a selected bibliography has been included for further discussion of specific topics. {FDA}’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required."},
