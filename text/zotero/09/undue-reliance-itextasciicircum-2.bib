	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: The heterogeneity statistic I{\textasciicircum}2, interpreted as the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity between studies rather than sampling error, depends on precision, that is, the size of the studies included. {METHODS}: Based on a real meta-analysis, we simulate artificially `inflating' the sample size under the random effects model. For a given inflation factor M = 1, 2, 3, ... and for each trial i, we create a M-inflated trial by drawing a treatment effect estimate from the random effects model, using s\_i{\textasciicircum}2/M as within-trial sampling variance. {RESULTS}: As precision increases, while estimates of the heterogeneity variance tau{\textasciicircum}2 remain unchanged on average, estimates of I{\textasciicircum}2 increase rapidly to nearly 100\%. A similar phenomenon is apparent in a sample of 157 meta-analyses. {CONCLUSION}: When deciding whether or not to pool treatment estimates in a meta-analysis, the yard-stick should be the clinical relevance of any heterogeneity present. tau{\textasciicircum}2, rather than I{\textasciicircum}2, is the appropriate measure for this purpose."},
