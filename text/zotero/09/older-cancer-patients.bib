	abstract = {Excerpt: "The majority of people diagnosed with cancer are over 65, but most major cancer studies exclude them, leaving a wide gap in knowledge about how best to treat older patients. The knowledge gap about older cancer patients was highlighted recently by researchers from Barcelona who studied the role that age played in the prognosis of 224 cancer patients."},
