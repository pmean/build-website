	abstract = {Excerpt: "This text grew out of chapters in the 1969 edition of Basic Research Methods in Social Science by the same author, and contains the first published example of what was later called the bootstrap. Simon is best known for his research in demography, population and the economics of natural resources, and gained fame when the noted biologist Paul Ehrlich selected five commodities and bet Simon that scarcity would drive their prices up over the period of the bet (in fact, their prices all dropped). Resampling: The New Statistics contains a number of examples in Resampling Stats, a computer program originated by Simon, but can be read on its own without the program."},
