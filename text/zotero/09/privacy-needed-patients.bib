Whilst only 11 per cent of researchers believed this should never happen, 53 per cent of the general public and 46 per cent of patients thought it was unacceptable without prior consent.

But more than half of researchers thought patient identifiable data should be used without patient consent if it had first been reviewed by the Patient Information Advisory Group ({PIAG}). Only 30 per cent of both patients and the general public agreed."},
