	abstract = {Abstract: "Sensory science uses the human senses as instruments of measures. This study presents univariate and multivariate data analysis methods to assess individual and group performances in a sensory panel. Green peas were evaluated by a trained panel of 10 assessors for six attributes over two replicates. A consonance analysis with Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) is run to get an overview of the panel agreement and detect major individual errors. The origin of the panelist errors is identi<U+2B1A>ed by a series of tests based on {ANOVA}: sensitivity, reproducibility, crossover and panel agreement, complemented with an eggshell-correlation test. One assessor is identi<U+2B1A>ed with further need for training in attributes pea fl<U+2B1A>avour, sweetness, fruity and off-fl<U+2B1A>avour, showing errors in sensitivity, reproducibility and crossover. Another assessor shows poor performance for attribute mealiness and to some extent also fruity <U+2B1A>avour. Only one panelist performs well to very well in all attributes. The speci<U+2B1A>city and complementarity of the series of univariate tests are explored and veri<U+2B1A>ed with the use of a {PCA} model. Keywords: Sensory panel performance; {ANOVA}; Agreement error; Sensitivity; Reproducibility; Crossover; Eggshell plot."},
