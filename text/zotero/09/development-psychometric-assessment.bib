	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Patients with respiratory disease experience disturbed sleep, but there is no widely accepted measure of sleep impairment due to respiratory disease. We developed and evaluated the psychometric performance of a patient-reported measure to assess the impact on sleep due to respiratory disease, the {COPD} and Asthma Sleep Impact Scale ({CASIS}). {METHODS}: Identification of the items forming the {CASIS} was guided by patient interviews and focus groups. An observational study involving patients from the {US} and {UK} was then conducted to assess the psychometric characteristics of the measure. {RESULTS}: Qualitative data from 162 patients were used to develop the {CASIS} (n=78 {COPD}; n=84 asthma). The observational study included 311 patients with {COPD} and 324 patients with asthma. The final seven items used in the {CASIS} were identified based on factor and item response theory analyses. Internal consistency was 0.90 ({COPD}) and 0.92 (asthma), and test-retest reliability was 0.84 (both groups). In the {COPD} sample, {CASIS} scores were significantly correlated with {SGRQ} scores (all p<0.0001) and differed significantly by patient-reported disease severity, exacerbation status, and overall health status (all p[less than or equal to]0.005). In the asthma sample, {CASIS} scores were significantly correlated with {AQLQ} scores (all p<0.0001) and differed significantly by clinician and patient-reported disease severity, exacerbation status, and overall health status (all p[less than or equal to]0.0005). {CONCLUSIONS}: The {CASIS} shows good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity and may be useful in helping to understand the impact that {COPD} and asthma have on sleep outcomes."},
