	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Hemodynamic instability following the changeover of vasoactive infusion pump ({CVIP}) is a common problem in the intensive care unit. Several empiric methods are used to achieve {CVIP}. We hypothesized that the variation in these procedures could generate some morbidity. We sought to assess the effects of the standardization of practice, as a quality improvement program, on the {CVIP}-induced incidents. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We performed a prospective before-and-after intervention study including all adult patients with a diagnosis of cardiovascular failure who received a continuous infusion of vasoactive drugs or inotropic drugs. After a baseline preimplementation period (phase 1), a standardized 'quick change method' of {CVIP} using two syringe drivers was implemented in our intensive care unit (phase 2). Endpoints (rate and distribution of incidents: variations of systolic blood pressure >20 {mmHg} or heart rate >20 beats/min, and arrhythmias) were registered in both 3-month phases. {RESULTS}: We studied a total of 913 {CVIP} events (phase 1, 435 events; phase 2, 478 events) from 43 patients. Patient characteristics were not significantly different among phases, with a majority of the patients having septic shock. The frequency of incidents was significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced in phase 2 (5.9%, n = 28) versus phase 1 (17.8%, n = 78). This effect was observed whichever catecholamine was used. More than 98% of incidents were blood pressure variations, with a similar distribution of the nature of incidents in both phases. {CONCLUSION}: The present study illustrates that adverse events are common following {CVIP}, and illustrates the positive impact of a quality improvement program to enhance inpatient safety related to this current process of care."},
