	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Meta-analysis is increasingly used as a key source of evidence synthesis to inform clinical practice. The theory and statistical foundations of meta-analysis continually evolve, providing solutions to many new and challenging problems. In practice, most meta-analyses are performed in general statistical packages or dedicated meta-analysis programs. {RESULTS}: Herein, we introduce Meta-Analyst, a novel, powerful, intuitive, and free meta-analysis program for the meta-analysis of a variety of problems. Meta-Analyst is implemented in C\# atop of the Microsoft .{NET} framework, and features a graphical user interface. The software performs several meta-analysis and meta-regression models for binary and continuous outcomes, as well as analyses for diagnostic and prognostic test studies in the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. Moreover, Meta-Analyst includes a flexible tool to edit and customize generated meta-analysis graphs (e.g., forest plots) and provides output in many formats (images, Adobe {PDF}, Microsoft Word-ready {RTF}). The software architecture employed allows for rapid changes to be made to either the Graphical User Interface ({GUI}) or to the analytic modules.
We verified the numerical precision of Meta-Analyst by comparing its output with that from standard meta-analysis routines in Stata over a large database of 11,803 meta-analyses of binary outcome data, and 6,881 meta-analyses of continuous outcome data from the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. Results from analyses of diagnostic and prognostic test studies have been verified in a limited number of meta-analyses versus {MetaDisc} and {MetaTest}. Bayesian statistical analyses use the {OpenBUGS} calculation engine (and are thus as accurate as the standalone {OpenBUGS} software). {CONCLUSION}: We have developed and validated a new program for conducting meta-analyses that combines the advantages of existing software for this task."},
