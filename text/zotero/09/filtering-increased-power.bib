	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Due to the large number of hypothesis tests performed during the process of routine analysis of microarray data, a multiple testing adjustment is certainly warranted. However, when the number of tests is very large and the proportion of differentially expressed genes is relatively low, the use of a multiple testing adjustment can result in very low power to detect those genes which are truly differentially expressed. Filtering allows for a reduction in the number of tests and a corresponding increase in power. Common filtering methods include filtering by variance, average signal or {MAS} detection call (for Affymetrix arrays). In this paper, we study the effects of filtering in combination with the Benjamini-Hochberg
method for false discovery rate control and q-value for false
discovery rate estimation.{RESULTS}:Three case studies are used to compare three different filtering methods in combination with the two false discovery rate methods and three different preprocessing methods. For the case studies considered, filtering by detection call and variance (on the original scale) consistently led to an increase in the number of differentially expressed genes identified. On the other hand, filtering by variance on the log2 scale had a detrimental effect when paired with {MAS}5 and {PLIER} preprocessing methods, even when the testing was done on the log2 scale. A simulation study was done to further examine the effect of filtering by variance. We find that filtering by variance leads to higher power, often with a decrease in false discovery rate, when paired with either false discovery rate method. This holds regardless of the proportion of genes which are differentially expressed or whether we assume dependence or independence among genes.{CONCLUSIONS}:The case studies show that both detection call and variance filtering are viable methods of filtering which can increase the number of differentially expressed genes identified. The simulation study demonstrates that when paired with a false discovery rate method, filtering by variance can increase power while still controlling the false discovery rate. Filtering out \$50{textbackslash}%\$ of probe sets seems reasonable as long as the majority of genes are not expected to be differentially expressed.},
