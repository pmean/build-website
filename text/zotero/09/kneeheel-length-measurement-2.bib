	abstract = {Description: This article provides an illustrative example of how to use the coefficient of variation to measure agreement on a continuous trait among several raters. Abstract: "{AIM}: To examine the reproducibility of crown-heel length measurement; the precision and reproducibility of knee-heel length measurement; and the association between the two in healthy preterm infants. {METHODS}: Paired crown-heel and knee-heel lengths were measured on 172 occasions by three observers in 43 preterm infants between 205and 458 days of postconceptional age. {RESULTS}: Crown-heel length ({CHL}) measurement was highly reproducible, with a coefficient of variation ({CV}) of 0.41%. Knee-heel length ({KHL}) measurement was relatively precise ({CV} 0.78%), but less reproducible (intra-observer {CV} 1.77%, intra-observer {CV} 2.11%), especially in larger infants. The association between {KHL} and {CHL} was not consistent and varied with age. {KHL} was a poor predictor of {CHL}, with a 95% predictive interval of <U+00B1> 27.5mm. {CONCLUSIONS}: {KHL} was less reproducible than {CHL}, especially in larger infants, and a poor predictor of {CHL}."},
