	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Stents are commonly used to treat patients with coronary artery disease. However, the quality of reporting internal and external validity data in published reports of randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}) of stents has never been assessed.
The objective of our study was to evaluate the quality of reporting internal and external validity data in published reports of {RCTs} assessing the stents for percutaneous coronary interventions. {METHODS}: A systematic literature review was conducted. Reports of {RCTs} assessing stents for percutaneous coronary interventions indexed in {MEDLINE} and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and published between January 2003 and September 2008 were selected. A standardized abstraction form was used to extract data. All analyses were adjusted for the effect of clustering articles by journal. {RESULTS}: 132 articles were analyzed. The generation of the allocation sequence was adequate in 58.3% of the reports; treatment allocation was concealed in 34.8%. Adequate blinding was reported in one-fifth of the reports. An intention-to-treat analysis was described in 79.5%. The main outcome was a surrogate angiographic endpoint in 47.0%. The volume of interventions per center was described in two reports. Operator expertise was described in five (3.8%) reports. The quality of reporting was better in journals with high impact factors and in journals endorsing the {CONSORT} statement. {CONCLUSIONS}: The current reporting of results of {RCTs} testing stents needs to be improved to allow readers to appraise the risk of bias and the applicability of the results."},
