	abstract = {Abstract: "There are certain challenges that confront virtually all health systems, irrespective of the means by which they are funded and administered. One such is the management of uncertainty: specifically, knowing what to do when data on the effectiveness or the cost-effectiveness of new medicines or procedures is incomplete or inadequate, but decisions have nonetheless to be taken on whether to purchase and supply them to patients. A similar issue arises when there is suspicion that a procedure or medicine already in use may be relatively ineffective or represent poor value for money."},
