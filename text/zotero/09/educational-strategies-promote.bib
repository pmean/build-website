They must simultaneously foster high-quality patient care and assess the clinical skills and reasoning of learners in order to promote their progress toward independence in the clinical setting. Clinical teachers must diagnose both the patient's clinical problem and the learner's ability and skill. To assess a learner's diagnostic reasoning strategies effectively, the teacher needs to consider how doctors learn to reason in the clinical environment."},
