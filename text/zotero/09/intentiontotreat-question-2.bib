	abstract = {Abstract: "It has become commonplace for Randomized Controlled Trials ({RCTs}) to be analyzed according to Intention-to-Treat ({ITT}) principles in which data from all subjects are used regardless of the subjects' adherence to protocol. While {ITT} analyses can provide useful information in some cases, they do not answer the question that motivates many {RCTs}, namely, whether the treatments differ in efficacy. {ITT} tends to reduce information by combining two questions, whether the intervention is effective and whether, as implemented, it has good compliance. Because these questions may be separate there is a risk of misuse. Two examples are presented that demonstrate this potential for abuse: a study on the effectiveness of vitamin E in reducing cardiovascular risk and comparisons of low fat and low carbohydrate diets. In the first case, a treatment that is demonstrably effective is described as without merit. In the second, {ITT} describes as the same, two diets that actually have different outcomes. These misuses of {ITT} are not atypical and are not technical problems in statistics but have real consequences for scientific principles and health recommendations. {ITT} analyses may answer the question of what happens when treatments are recommended but are inappropriate where separate information on adherence and performance is available. It is proposed that results of {RCTs}, or any experimental study, be reported, not in terms of the analyses that were performed, but rather in terms of the questions that the analyses can answer properly."},
