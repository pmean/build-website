	abstract = {Abstract: "The accuracy of a binary-scale diagnostic test can be represented by sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and positive and negative predictive values ({PPV} and {NPV}). Although Se and Sp measure the intrinsic accuracy of a diagnostic test that does not depend on the prevalence rate, they do not provide information on the diagnostic accuracy of a particular patient. To obtain this information we need to use {PPV} and {NPV}. Since {PPV} and {NPV} are functions of both the accuracy of the test and the prevalence of the disease, constructing their confidence intervals for a particular patient is not straightforward. In this paper, a novel method for the estimation of {PPV} and {NPV}, as well as their confidence intervals, is developed. For both predictive values, standard, adjusted and their logit transformed-based confidence intervals are compared using coverage probabilities and interval lengths in a simulation study. These methods are then applied to two case-control studies: a diagnostic test assessing the ability of the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene ({ApoE}.e4) on distinguishing patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) and a prognostic test assessing the predictive ability of a 70-gene signature on breast cancer metastasis.
