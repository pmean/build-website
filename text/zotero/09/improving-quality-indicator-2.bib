	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: The National Database for Nursing Quality Indicators(R) ({NDNQI}(R)) was established in 1998 to assist hospitals in monitoring indicators of nursing quality (eg, falls and pressure ulcers). Hospitals participating in {NDNQI} transmit data from nursing units to an {NDNQI} data repository. Data are summarized and published in reports that allow participating facilities to compare the results for their units with those from other units across the nation. A disadvantage of this reporting scheme is that the sampling variability is not explicit. For example, suppose a small nursing unit that has 2 out of 10 (rate of 20\%) patients with pressure ulcers. Should the nursing unit immediately undertake a quality improvement plan because of the rate difference from the national average (7\%). {METHODS}: In this paper, we propose approximating 95\% credible intervals ({CrIs}) for unit-level data using statistical models that account for the variability in unit rates for report cards. {RESULTS}: Bayesian {CrIs} communicate the level of uncertainty of estimates more clearly to decision makers than other significance tests. {CONCLUSION}: A benefit of this approach is that nursing units would be better able to distinguish problematic or beneficial trends from fluctuations likely due to chance."},
