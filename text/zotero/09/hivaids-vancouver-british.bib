	abstract = {The prevalence of {HIV} in Vancouver, British Columbia was subject to two distinct periods of rapid increase. The first occurred in the 1980s due to high incidence among men who have sex with men ({MSM}), and the second occurred in the 1990s due to high incidence among injection drug users ({IDU}). The purpose of this study was to estimate and model the trends in {HIV} prevalence in Vancouver from 1980 to 2006. {HIV} prevalence data were entered into the {UNAIDS}/{WHO} Estimation and Projection Package ({EPP}) where prevalence trends were estimated by fitting an epidemiological model to the data. Epidemic curves were fit for {IDU}, {MSM}, female sex trade workers ({FSW}), and the general population. Using {EPP}, these curves were then aggregated to produce a model of Vancouver's overall {HIV} prevalence. Of the 505 000 people over the age of 15 that reside in Vancouver, 6108 (ranging from 4979 to 7237) were living with {HIV} in the year 2006, giving an overall prevalence of 1.21 percent (ranging from 0.99 to 1.43 percent). The subgroups of {IDU} and {MSM} account for the greatest proportion of {HIV} infections. Our model estimates that the prevalence of {HIV} in Vancouver is greater than one percent, roughly 6 times higher than Canada's national prevalence. These results suggest that {HIV} infection is having a relatively large impact in Vancouver and that evidence-based prevention and harm reduction strategies should be expanded.},
