	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Significant event analysis ({SEA}) is promoted as a team-based approach to enhancing patient safety through reflective learning. Evidence of {SEA} participation is required for appraisal and contractual purposes in {UK} general practice. A voluntary educational model in the west of Scotland enables general practitioners ({GPs}) and doctors-in-training to submit {SEA} reports for feedback from trained peers. We reviewed reports to identify the range of safety issues analysed, learning needs raised and actions taken by {GP} teams. {METHOD}: Content analysis of {SEA} reports submitted in an 18 month period between 2005 and 2007.{RESULTS}:191 {SEA} reports were reviewed. 48 described patient harm (25.1%). A further 109 reports (57.1%) outlined circumstances that had the potential to cause patient harm. Individual 'error' was cited as the most common reason for event occurrence (32.5%). Learning opportunities were identified in 182 reports (95.3%) but were often non-specific professional issues not shared with the wider practice team. 154 {SEA} reports (80.1%) described actions taken to improve practice systems or professional behaviour. However, non-medical staff were less likely to be involved in the changes resulting from event analyses describing patient harm (p < 0.05). {CONCLUSION}: The study provides some evidence of the potential of {SEA} to improve healthcare quality and safety. If applied rigorously, {GP} teams and doctors in training can use the technique to investigate and learn from a wide variety of quality issues including those resulting in patient harm. This leads to reported change but it is unclear if such improvement is sustained."},
