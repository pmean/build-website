	abstract = {Abstract: "Drawing on the Foucauldian concept of 'governmentality' to analyse the evidence-based movement in nursing, we argue that it is possible to identify the governance of nursing practice and hence nurses across two distinct axes; that of the political (governance through political and economic means) and the personal (governance of the self through the cultivation of the practices required by nurses to put evidence into practice). The evaluation of nursing work through evidence-based reviews provides detailed information that may enable governments to target and instruct nurses regarding their work in the interest of preserving the health of the population as a whole. Political governance of the nursing population becomes possible through centralised discursive mechanisms, such as evidence-based reviews that present nursing practice as an intelligible field whose elements are connected in a more or less systematic manner. The identity of the evidence-based nurse requires the modern nurse to develop new skills and attitudes. Evidence-based nursing is an emerging technology of government that judges nursing research and knowledge and has the capacity to direct nursing practice at both the political and personal level."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{AIM}: This paper presents a conceptual analysis of the concept of bio-power in the context of nursing, including a critique of the widespread rhetoric that nursing is deprived of power and consequently is an apolitical agency. {BACKGROUND}: Traditionally, power tends to be defined in terms of repression, interdiction and punishment. On the contrary, work by Michel Foucault with regard to bio-power brings into evidence the productive and positive nature of power at the heart of society. Despite being often used by various academic and professional disciplines, the concept of bio-power is rarely cited in nursing. {FINDINGS}: Nursing as a profession is at the heart of bio-power in that nurses lie at the crossroads between the anatomo-political and bio-political ranges of power over life. They therefore contribute to social regulation through a vast array of diverse political technologies. Nurses are at the flexing point of the state's requirements and of individual and collective aspirations. They occupy a strategic position that allows them to act as instruments of governmentality. Consequently, nurses constitute a fully-fledged political entity making use of disciplinary technologies and responding to state ideologies. {CONCLUSION}: The concept of bio-power offers a rich theoretical perspective for nursing, as it questions the definition of nursing care as neutral and mainly provided according to patients' best interests."},

His 1979 study (Needleman et al., 1979), on the effects of low-level lead exposure on children, is widely cited and highly influential in the formulation of public policy on lead. The opportunity we had to examine subject selection and data analyses from this study was prematurely halted by efforts to prevent disclosure of our observations.

The debate on evidence-based medicine ({EBM}) is at the tip of this 'iceberg'. Via systems thinking and complexity science {EBM} reveals crucial flaws and its reductionism entails an inability to appreciate (even tolerate) contrasting ideas and/or 'see a bigger picture'. An interdisciplinary approach provides insight into novel explanations. Thereafter, the conceptual barrier shifts to communication, a challenge which mandates attempts to steer the discourse by reframing the debate. {METHOD}: Interdisciplinary perspectives serve to illustrate a 'bigger picture'. Also, 'wicked' questions stimulate reflection, discern leverage points and dismantle resilient defences. Lastly, a proposal: exploring the value of 'glasses half full'. {CONCLUSION}: Some may realize that postmodern concepts behind compelling criticisms to {EBM} have already taken root, being shared by policymakers, practitioners and patients as well.},

	abstract = {To correct for confounding, the method of instrumental variables ({IV}) has been proposed. Its use in medical literature is still rather limited because of unfamiliarity or inapplicability. By introducing the method in a nontechnical way, we show that {IV} in a linear model is quite easy to understand and easy to apply once an appropriate instrumental variable has been identified. We also point out some limitations of the {IV} estimator when the instrumental variable is only weakly correlated with the exposure. The {IV} estimator will be imprecise (large standard error), biased when sample size is small, and biased in large samples when one of the assumptions is only slightly violated. For these reasons, it is advised to use an {IV} that is strongly correlated with exposure. However, we further show that under the assumptions required for the validity of the method, this correlation between {IV} and exposure is limited. Its maximum is low when confounding is strong, such as in case of confounding by indication. Finally, we show that in a study in which strong confounding is to be expected and an {IV} has been used that is moderately or strongly related to exposure, it is likely that the assumptions of {IV} are violated, resulting in a biased effect estimate. We conclude that instrumental variables can be useful in case of moderate confounding but are less useful when strong confounding exists, because strong instruments cannot be found and assumptions will be easily violated.},

We used published and unpublished information from randomised clinical trials ({RCTs}) of dexketoprofen in painful conditions to assess evidence on efficacy and harm. {METHODS}: {PubMed} and Cochrane Central were searched for {RCTs} of dexketoprofen for pain of any aetiology. Reference lists of retrieved articles and reviews were also searched. Menarini Group produced copies of published and unpublished studies (clinical trial reports). Data were abstracted into a standard form. For studies reporting results of single dose administration, the number of patients with at least 50\% pain relief was derived and used to calculate the relative benefit ({RB}) and number-needed-to-treat ({NNT}) for one patient to achieve at least 50\% pain relief compared with placebo. {RESULTS}: Thirty-five trials were found in acute pain and chronic pain; 6,380 patients were included, 3,381 receiving dexketoprofen. Information from 16 trials (almost half the total patients) was obtained from clinical trial reports from previously unpublished trials or abstracts. Almost all of the trials were of short duration in acute conditions or recent onset pain.All 12 randomised trials that compared dexketoprofen (any dose) with placebo found dexketoprofen to be statistically superior. Five trials in postoperative pain yielded {NNTs} for 12.5 mg dexketoprofen of 3.5 (2.7 to 4.9), 25 mg dexketoprofen of 3.0 (2.4 to 3.9), and 50 mg dexketoprofen of 2.1 (1.5 to 3.5). In 29/30 active comparator trials, dexketoprofen at the dose used was at least equivalent in efficacy to comparator drugs. Adverse event withdrawal rates were low in postoperative pain and somewhat higher in trials of longer duration; no serious adverse events were reported. {CONCLUSION}: Dexketoprofen was at least as effective as other {NSAIDs} and paracetamol/opioid combinations. While adverse event withdrawal was not different between dexketoprofen and comparator analgesics, the different conditions and comparators studies precluded any formal analysis. Exposure was limited, and no conclusions could be drawn about safety in terms of serious adverse events like gastrointestinal bleeding or cardiovascular events."},

The objective of this study was to determine the discordance in interpretations when meta-analysts are presented with identical data. {METHODS}: We searched the literature for all randomized clinical trials ({RCT}) and review articles on the efficacy of intravenous magnesium in the early post-myocardial infarction period. We organized the articles chronologically and grouped them in packages. The first package included the first {RCT}, and a summary of the review articles published prior to first {RCT}. The second package contained the second and third {RCT}, a meta-analysis based on the data, and a summary of all review articles published prior to the third {RCT}. Similar packages were created for the 5th {RCT}, 10th {RCT}, 20th {RCT} and 23rd {RCT} (all articles). We presented the packages one at a time to eight different reviewers and asked them to answer three clinical questions after each package based solely on the information provided. The clinical questions included whether 1) they believed magnesium is now proven beneficial, 2) they believed magnesium will eventually be proven to be beneficial, and 3) they would recommend its use at this time. {RESULTS}: There was considerable disagreement among the reviewers for each package, and for each question. The discrepancies increased when the heterogeneity of the data increased. In addition, some reviewers became more sceptical of the effectiveness of magnesium over time, and some reviewers became less sceptical. {CONCLUSION}: The interpretation of the results of systematic reviews with meta-analyses includes a subjective component that can lead to discordant conclusions that are independent of the methodology used to obtain or analyse the data."},

The objectives were to examine the distribution of differences that researchers aim to detect in clinical trials and to verify that those differences are smaller in noninferiority compared to superiority trials. {METHODS}: Cross-sectional study based on a random sample of two hundred two-arm, parallel group superiority (100) and noninferiority (100) randomized clinical trials published between 2004 and 2009 in 27 leading medical journals. The main outcome measure was the smallest difference in favor of the new treatment to be detected (superiority trials) or largest unfavorable difference to be ruled out (noninferiority trials) used for sample size computation, expressed as standardized difference in proportions, or standardized difference in means. Student t test and analysis of variance were used. {RESULTS}: The differences to be detected or ruled out varied considerably from one study to the next; e.g., for superiority trials, the standardized difference in means ranged from 0.007 to 0.87, and the standardized difference in proportions from 0.04 to 1.56. On average, superiority trials were designed to detect larger differences than noninferiority trials (standardized difference in proportions: mean 0.37 versus 0.27, P = 0.001; standardized difference in means: 0.56 versus 0.40, P = 0.006). Standardized differences were lower for mortality than for other outcomes, and lower in cardiovascular trials than in other research areas. {CONCLUSIONS}: Superiority trials are designed to detect larger differences than noninferiority trials are designed to rule out. The variability between studies is considerable and is partly explained by the type of outcome and the medical context. A more explicit and rational approach to choosing the difference to be detected or to be ruled out in clinical trials may be desirable."},

We assessed the frequency of omitted data on the example of the Date of Relapse field. We considered the data in this field to be omitted for all records that had empty Date of Relapse field and evidence of relapse elsewhere in the record. {RESULTS}: A total of 1,156 records were updated and 200 new records were entered in the database over the study period. "Summary Page" was accessed for 44\% of all updated records and for 69\% of newly entered records. Frequency of correction of the omitted date of cancer relapse was six-fold higher in records for which "Summary Page" was accessed (p = 0.0003). {CONCLUSIONS}: "Summary Page" was strongly associated with an increased frequency of correction of omitted data errors.

In order to determine reasonable values for such parameters, they may design a small pilot study external to the main trial. In this paper we propose designs, which we term internal pilot studies, that designate a portion of the main trial as a pilot phase. At the end of the internal pilot study, the investigators recompute preselected parameters and recalculate required sample size. The study then proceeds with the modifications dictated by the internal pilot. Final analyses of the results incorporate all data, disregarding the fact that part of the data came from a pilot phase. As one example of this type of design, we consider a study to compare two normally distributed means. By simulation, we show a numerical example for which the effect of the procedure on the alpha-level is negligible, but the potential gain in power considerable.

	abstract = {Abstract: "When designing a clinical trial, there is usually some uncertainty about the variability of the primary outcome variable. This may lead to an unnecessarily high or inadequately low sample size. The internal pilot study approach uses data from patients recruited up to an interim stage to re-estimate the variance and to re-calculate the final sample size accordingly. Previously, simulation studies have shown that this methodology may highly improve the chance to obtain a well-powered trial. However, it also turned out that the type I error rate may be inflated by this procedure. We quantify the maximum excess of the type I error rate for normally distributed outcomes. If strict control of the alpha-level is considered to be an important issue, a method is proposed to achieve this when re-calculating the sample size in internal pilot studies. The characteristics of the power distributions are investigated for various sample size adaptation rules and implications are discussed."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: When subgroup analyses of a positive clinical trial are unrevealing, such findings are commonly used to argue that the treatment's benefits apply to the entire study population; however, such analyses are often limited by poor statistical power. Multivariable risk-stratified analysis has been proposed as an important advance in investigating heterogeneity in treatment benefits, yet no one has conducted a systematic statistical examination of circumstances influencing the relative merits of this approach vs. conventional subgroup analysis. {METHODS}: Using simulated clinical trials in which the probability of outcomes in individual patients was stochastically determined by the presence of risk factors and the effects of treatment, we examined the relative merits of a conventional vs. a "risk-stratified" subgroup analysis under a variety of circumstances in which there is a small amount of uniformly distributed treatment-related harm. The statistical power to detect treatment-effect heterogeneity was calculated for risk-stratified and conventional subgroup analysis while varying: 1) the number, prevalence and odds ratios of individual risk factors for risk in the absence of treatment, 2) the predictiveness of the multivariable risk model (including the accuracy of its weights), 3) the degree of treatment-related harm, and 5) the average untreated risk of the study population. {RESULTS}: Conventional subgroup analysis (in which single patient attributes are evaluated "one-at-a-time") had at best moderate statistical power (30\% to 45\%) to detect variation in a treatment's net relative risk reduction resulting from treatment-related harm, even under optimal circumstances (overall statistical power of the study was good and treatment-effect heterogeneity was evaluated across a major risk factor [{OR} = 3]). In some instances a multi-variable risk-stratified approach also had low to moderate statistical power (especially when the multivariable risk prediction tool had low discrimination). However, a multivariable risk-stratified approach can have excellent statistical power to detect heterogeneity in net treatment benefit under a wide variety of circumstances, instances under which conventional subgroup analysis has poor statistical power. {CONCLUSION}: These results suggest that under many likely scenarios, a multivariable risk-stratified approach will have substantially greater statistical power than conventional subgroup analysis for detecting heterogeneity in treatment benefits and safety related to previously unidentified treatment-related harm. Subgroup analyses must always be well-justified and interpreted with care, and conventional subgroup analyses can be useful under some circumstances; however, clinical trial reporting should include a multivariable risk-stratified analysis when an adequate externally-developed risk prediction tool is available.},

Thus, some have suggested that clinical trial results should routinely be stratified by outcome risk using risk models, since the summary results may otherwise be misleading. However, variation in competing risk is another dimension of risk heterogeneity that may also underlie treatment effect heterogeneity. Understanding the effects of competing risk heterogeneity may be especially important for pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials, which seek to include traditionally excluded patients, such as the elderly or complex patients with multiple comorbidities. Indeed, the observed effect of an intervention is dependent on the ratio of outcome risk to competing risk, and these risks - which may or may not be correlated - may vary considerably in patients enrolled in a trial. Further, the effects of competing risk on treatment effect heterogeneity can be amplified by even a small degree of treatment related harm. Stratification of trial results along both the competing and the outcome risk dimensions may be necessary if pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials are to provide the clinically useful information their advocates intend."},

Randomization, a process by which patients are assigned to a treatment arm by chance rather than by choice, was a brilliant innovation that has made possible causal inferences regarding a treatment’s effect. Although randomization is not perfect in practice, it is remarkably effective at ensuring the comparability between treatment groups, so much so that it has almost tricked us into thinking that patient differences in outcome risks have been rendered irrelevant in the context of clinical trials."},

Conventional subgroup analyses, which examine whether specific patient characteristics modify the effects of treatment, are usually unable to detect even large variations in treatment benefit (and harm) across risk groups because they do not account for the fact that patients have multiple characteristics simultaneously that affect the likelihood of treatment benefit. Based upon recent evidence on optimal statistical approaches to assessing {HTE}, we propose a framework that prioritizes the analysis and reporting of multivariate risk-based {HTE} and suggests that other subgroup analyses should be explicitly labeled either as primary subgroup analyses (well-motivated by prior evidence and intended to produce clinically actionable results) or secondary (exploratory) subgroup analyses (performed to inform future research).

	abstract = {Description: A fairly technical book, but what book about Bayesian methods is not? The first chapter provides a detailed explanation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The remaining chapter provide some very sophisticated examples. Excerpt: "Bayesian methods combine the evidence from the data at hand with previous quantitative knowledge to analyse practical problems in a wide range of areas. The calculations were previously complex, but it is now possible to routinely apply Bayesian methods due to advances in computing technology and the use of new sampling methods for estimating parameters. Such developments together with the availability of freeware such as {WINBUGS} and R have facilitated a rapid growth in the use of Bayesian methods, allowing their application in many scientific disciplines, including applied statistics, public health research, medical science, the social sciences and economics. Following the success of the first edition, this reworked and updated book provides an accessible approach to Bayesian computing and analysis, with an emphasis on the principles of prior selection, identification and the interpretation of real data sets. The second edition: * Provides an integrated presentation of theory, examples, applications and computer algorithms. * Discusses the role of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in computing and estimation. * Includes a wide range of interdisciplinary applications, and a large selection of worked examples from the health and social sciences. * Features a comprehensive range of methodologies and modelling techniques, and examines model fitting in practice using Bayesian principles. * Provides exercises designed to help reinforce the reader’s knowledge and a supplementary website containing data sets and relevant programs. Bayesian Statistical Modelling is ideal for researchers in applied statistics, medical science, public health and the social sciences, who will benefit greatly from the examples and applications featured. The book will also appeal to graduate students of applied statistics, data analysis and Bayesian methods, and will provide a great source of reference for both researchers and students."},

Emphasizing computational issues, the book provides examples of the following application settings: meta-analysis, data structured in space or time, multilevel and longitudinal data, multivariate data, nonlinear regression, and survival time data. For the worked examples, the text mainly employs the {WinBUGS} package, allowing readers to explore alternative likelihood assumptions, regression structures, and assumptions on prior densities. It also incorporates {BayesX} code, which is particularly useful in nonlinear regression. To demonstrate {MCMC} sampling from first principles, the author includes worked examples using the R package. Through illustrative data analysis and attention to statistical computing, this book focuses on the practical implementation of Bayesian hierarchical methods. It also discusses several issues that arise when applying Bayesian techniques in hierarchical and random effects models."},

The authors discuss the computation of estimates and give numerous examples using real data. The book also includes an extensive treatment of estimating variance functions in regression."},

Many of the problems of conducting randomised trials could often, in theory, be overcome, but the practical implications for researchers and funding bodies mean that this is often not possible. The false conflict between those who advocate randomised trials in all situations and those who believe observational data provide sufficient evidence needs to be replaced with mutual recognition of the complementary roles of the two approaches.

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Physicians' financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry are controversial because such relationships may pose a conflict of interest. It is unknown to what extent industry support of medical education and research influences the opinions and behavior of clinicians and researchers. The recent debate over the safety of calcium-channel antagonists provided an opportunity to examine the effect of financial conflicts of interest. {METHODS}: We searched the English-language medical literature published from March 1995 through September 1996 for articles examining the controversy about the safety of calcium-channel antagonists. Articles were reviewed and classified as being supportive, neutral, or critical with respect to the use of calcium-channel antagonists. The authors of the articles were asked about their financial relationships with both manufacturers of calcium-channel antagonists and manufacturers of competing products (i.e., beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and nitrates). We examined the authors' published positions on the safety of calcium-channel antagonists according to their financial relationships with pharmaceutical companies. {RESULTS}: Authors who supported the use of calcium-channel antagonists were significantly more likely than neutral or critical authors to have financial relationships with manufacturers of calcium-channel antagonists (96 percent, vs. 60 percent and 37 percent, respectively; P{\textless}0.001). Supportive authors were also more likely than neutral or critical authors to have financial relationships with any pharmaceutical manufacturer, irrespective of the product (100 percent, vs. 67 percent and 43 percent, respectively; P{\textless} 0.001). {CONCLUSIONS}: Our results demonstrate a strong association between authors' published positions on the safety of calcium-channel antagonists and their financial relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers. The medical profession needs to develop a more effective policy on conflict of interest. We support complete disclosure of relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers for clinicians and researchers who write articles examining pharmaceutical products."},

Design: Ten methodologists affiliated with the Cochrane Collaboration independently examined, in a semistructured way, the quality of reviews first published in 1998. Each review was assessed by two people; if one of them noted any major problems, they agreed on a common assessment. Predominant types of problem were categorised. Setting: Cyberspace collaboration coordinated from the Nordic Cochrane Centre. Studies: All 53 reviews first published in issue 4 of the Cochrane Library in 1998. Main outcome measure: Proportion of reviews with various types of major problem. Results: No problems or only minor ones were found in most reviews. Major problems were identified in 15 reviews (29\%). The evidence did not fully support the conclusion in nine reviews (17\%), the conduct or reporting was unsatisfactory in 12 reviews (23\%), and stylistic problems were identified in 12 reviews (23\%). The problematic conclusions all gave too favourable a picture of the experimental intervention. Conclusions: Cochrane reviews have previously been shown to be of higher quality and less biased on average than other systematic reviews, but improvement is always possible. The Cochrane Collaboration has taken steps to improve editorial processes and the quality of its reviews. Meanwhile, the Cochrane Library remains a key source of evidence about the effects of healthcare interventions. Its users should interpret reviews cautiously, particularly those with conclusions favouring experimental interventions and those with many typographical errors."},

The status of these journals was ascertained in {MEDLINE} as having {FUTON}, abstracts only, and {NAA} (no abstract available). Impact factors for all available journals from the Institute for Scientific Information ({ISI}) were abstracted. {RESULTS}: Of the 324 Journals, 124 (38.3\%) were {FUTON}, 138 (42.6\%) had abstracts only, and 62 (19.1\%) had {NAA}. The mean (+/-{SEM}) impact factor was 3.24 (+/-0.32), 1.64 (+/-0.30), and 0.14 (+/-0.45), respectively. Of the 324 current journals, 159 existed in both the pre- and the post-Internet era. An analysis of the change (ie, delta) in impact factor from the pre- to post-Internet era revealed a trend between journals with {FUTON} and abstracts only (P=.17, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Similar analyses of the delta of cardiology journals revealed a statistically significant difference between Journals with {FUTON} and abstracts only (P=.04, Wilcoxon rank sum test). {CONCLUSION}: {FUTON} bias is the tendency to peruse what is more readily available. This is the first study to show that on-line availability of medical literature may increase the impact factor and that such increase tends to be greater in {FUTON} journals. Failure to consider this bias may affect a journal's impact factor. Also, it could limit consideration of medical literature by ignoring relevant {NAA} articles and thereby influence medical education akin to publication or language bias."},

Our research attempts to construct an appropriate theoretical edifice by which we can understand this sexual practice. In order to achieve this objective, a qualitative design was selected and 18 semiconductive in-depth interviews were carried out with barebackers from five European and North American cities. We then analyzed the data using two theoretical approaches that were sensitive to the issues of desire, transgression and pleasure. These theories are those of the late French psychoanalyst, Jacques Lacan, and those of poststructural thinkers, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. These theoretical frameworks helped shed light on the significance of bareback sex, and can potentially influence healthcare providers in gaining a better understanding not only of their clients, but also of their own role in the circuitry of desire at work within bareback. We found that while the exchange of semen constitutes a dangerous and irrational practice to healthcare professionals, it is nevertheless a significant variable in the sexual lives of barebackers that needs to be taken into consideration in the provision of healthcare services."},

While the media attention helped to speed up the identification of errors, leading to a retraction of the review after only 13 days, a paper published in this issue of {JMIR} by Rada shows that the retraction, in contrast to the original review, remained largely unnoticed by the public. We discuss the three flaws of the review, which include (1) data extraction and coding errors, (2) the pooling of heterogeneous studies, and (3) a problematic and ambiguous scope and, possibly, some overlooked studies. We then discuss "retraction ethics" for researchers, editors/publishers, and journalists. Researchers and editors should, in the case of retractions, match the aggressiveness of the original dissemination campaign if errors are detected. It is argued that researchers and their organizations may have an ethical obligation to track down journalists who reported stories on the basis of a flawed study and to specifically ask them to publish an article indicating the error. Journalists should respond to errors or retractions with reports that have the same prominence as the original story. Finally, we look at some of the lessons for the Cochrane Collaboration, which include (1) improving the peer-review system by routinely sending out pre-prints to authors of the original studies, (2) avoiding downplay of the magnitude of errors if they occur, (3) addressing the usability issues of {RevMan}, and (4) making critical articles such as retraction notices open access."},

Through detailed explanations about how to integrate value-based medicine and macroeconomic issues, this resource will teach practitioners how to deliver a higher quality of clinical care and to measure and demonstrate the value of their interventions to patients, policymakers, and payers. Also included are innovative input variable methodologies, a critical appraisal of health-related quality-of-life instruments, and an overview of healthcare economics. "},

	abstract = {Abstract: "In recent years, there have been calls within the United Kingdom's National Health Service ({NHS}) for evidence-based health care. These resonate with long-standing calls for nursing to become a research-based profession. Evidence-based practice could enable nurses to demonstrate their unique contribution to health care outcomes, and support their seeking greater professionalization, in terms of enhanced authority and autonomy. Nursing's professionalization project, and, within this, various practices comprising the 'new nursing', whilst sometimes not delivering all that was hoped of them, have been important in developing certain conditions conducive to developing evidence-based practice, notably a critical perspective on practice and a reluctance merely to follow physicians' orders. However, nursing has often been hesitant in its adoption of quantitative and experimental research. This hesitancy, it is argued, has been influenced by the propounding by some authors within the new nursing of a stereotyped view of quantitative/experimental methods which equates them with a number of methodological and philosophical points which are deemed, by at least some of these authors, as inimical to, or problematic within, nursing research. It is argued that, not only is the logic on which the various stereotyped views are based flawed, but further, that the wider influence of these viewpoints on nurses could lead to a greater marginalization of nurses in research and evidence-based practice initiatives, thus perhaps leading to evidence-based nursing being led by other groups. In the longer term, this might result in a form of evidence-based nursing emphasizing routinization, thus--ironically--working against strategies of professional authority and autonomy embedded in the new nursing. Nursing research should instead follow the example of nurse researchers who already embrace multiple methods. While the paper describes United Kingdom experiences and debates, points raised about the importance of questioning stereotyped views of research should have international relevance."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: High accrual to clinical trials enables new treatment strategies to be tested rapidly, accurately and with generalisability. Ethical standards also must be high so that participation is voluntary and informed. However, this can be difficult to achieve in trials with complex designs and those which are closely embedded in clinical practice. Optimal recruitment requires a balance of both ethical and accrual considerations. In the context of a trial of stratified treatments for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ({UKALL}2003) we examined how recruitment looked to an observer and how it felt to the parents, to identify how doctors' communication could promote or inhibit optimal recruitment. {METHODS}: We audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed routine doctor-patient consultations (n=20) and interviews between researchers and parents (n=30 parents) across six {UK} treatment centres. Analysis was informed by the constant comparative method. For consultation transcripts analysis focussed on how doctors presented the trial. We compared this with analysis of the interview transcripts which focussed on parents' perceptions and understanding of the trial. {RESULTS}: Parents and doctors discussed the trial in the majority of consultations, even in those that did not involve making a decision about randomisation. Doctors used language allying them both with the trial and with the parent, indicating that they were both an 'investigator' and a 'clinician. They presented the trial both as an empirical study with a scientific imperative and also as offering personalisation of treatment for the child. Parents appeared to understand that trial involvement was voluntary, that it was different from routine care and that they could withdraw from the trial at any time. Some were confused about the significance of the {MRD} test and the personalisation of treatment. {CONCLUSIONS}: Doctors communicated in ways that generally promoted optimal recruitment indicating that trials can be embedded into clinical practice. However, parents were unclear about some particular details of the trial's rationale suggesting that recruitment to trials with complicated designs, such as those involving stratified treatments, might need enhanced explanation."},

Seventy-six thousand, seven hundred and seventy-five eligible individuals completed the baseline survey and were presumed alive at the time of follow-up; of these, 54,960 (71.6\%) completed the first follow-up survey. Logistic regression models were used to calculate inverse probability weights using propensity scores. {RESULTS}: Characteristics associated with a greater probability of response included female gender, older age, higher education level, officer rank, active-duty status, and a self-reported history of military exposures. Ever smokers, those with a history of chronic alcohol consumption or a major depressive disorder, and those separated from the military at follow-up had a lower probability of response. Nonresponse to the follow-up questionnaire did not result in appreciable bias; bias was greatest in subgroups with small numbers. {CONCLUSIONS}: These findings suggest that prospective analyses from this cohort are not substantially biased by non-response at the first follow-up assessment."},

We develop and validate polytomous models (models that predict more than two events) to diagnose ovarian tumors as benign, borderline, primary invasive or metastatic invasive. The main focus is on how different types of models perform and compare. {METHODS}: A multi-center dataset containing 1066 women was used for model development and internal validation, whilst another multi-center dataset of 1938 women was used for temporal and external validation. Models were based on standard logistic regression and on penalized kernel-based algorithms (least squares support vector machines and kernel logistic regression). We used true polytomous models as well as combinations of dichotomous models based on the 'pairwise coupling' technique to produce polytomous risk estimates. Careful variable selection was performed, based largely on cross-validated c-index estimates. Model performance was assessed with the dichotomous c-index (i.e. the area under the {ROC} curve) and a polytomous extension, and with calibration graphs. {RESULTS}: For all models, between 9 and 11 predictors were selected. Internal validation was successful with polytomous c-indexes between 0.64 and 0.69. For the best model dichotomous c-indexes were between 0.73 (primary invasive vs metastatic) and 0.96 (borderline vs metastatic). On temporal and external validation, overall discrimination performance was good with polytomous c-indexes between 0.57 and 0.64. However, discrimination between primary and metastatic invasive tumors decreased to near random levels. Standard logistic regression performed well in comparison with advanced algorithms, and combining dichotomous models performed well in comparison with true polytomous models. The best model was a combination of dichotomous logistic regression models. This model is available online. {CONCLUSIONS}: We have developed models that successfully discriminate between benign, borderline, and invasive ovarian tumors. Methodologically, the combination of dichotomous models was an interesting approach to tackle the polytomous problem. Standard logistic regression models were not outperformed by regularized kernel-based alternatives, a finding to which the careful variable selection procedure will have contributed. The random discrimination between primary and metastatic invasive tumors on temporal/external validation demonstrated once more the necessity of validation studies."},

In missing-at-random scenarios, the Kaplan-Meier method was associated with a bias ranging from -5.1\% to 7.0\% and with a very poor coverage rate (as low as 0.2\%).

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: The identification of health services research in databases such as {PubMed}/Medline is a cumbersome task. This task becomes even more difficult if the field of interest involves the use of diverse methods and data sources, as is the case with nurse staffing research. This type of research investigates the association between nurse staffing parameters and nursing and patient outcomes. A comprehensively developed search strategy may help identify nurse staffing research in {PubMed}/Medline. {METHODS}: A set of relevant references in {PubMed}/Medline was identified by means of three systematic reviews. This development set was used to detect candidate free-text and {MeSH} terms. The frequency of these terms was compared to a random sample from {PubMed}/Medline in order to identify terms specific to nurse staffing research, which were then used to develop a sensitive, precise and balanced search strategy. To determine their precision, the newly developed search strategies were tested against a) the pool of relevant references extracted from the systematic reviews, b) a reference set identified from an electronic journal screening, and c) a sample from {PubMed}/Medline. Finally, all newly developed strategies were compared to {PubMed}'s Health Services Research Queries ({PubMed}'s {HSR} Queries). {RESULTS}: The sensitivities of the newly developed search strategies were almost 100\% in all of the three test sets applied; precision ranged from 6.1\% to 32.0\%. {PubMed}'s {HSR} queries were less sensitive (83.3\% to 88.2\%) than the new search strategies. Only minor differences in precision were found (5.0\% to 32.0\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: As with other literature on health services research, nurse staffing studies are difficult to identify in {PubMed}/Medline. Depending on the purpose of the search, researchers can choose between high sensitivity and retrieval of a large number of references or high precision, i.e. and an increased risk of missing relevant references, respectively. More standardized terminology (e.g. by consistent use of the term "nurse staffing") could improve the precision of future searches in this field. Empirically selected search terms can help to develop effective search strategies. The high consistency between all test sets confirmed the validity of our approach."},

They were asked to interpret a hypothetical diagnostic test, presented in four versions that differed in the distributions of test scores in diseased and non-diseased populations. Each student received only one version. The intuitive application of the statistical test approach would lead to rejecting the null hypothesis of no disease in version A, and to accepting the null in version B. Application of the likelihood ratio approach led to opposite conclusions - against the disease in A, and in favour of disease in B. Version C tested the importance of the p-value (A: 0.04 versus C: 0.08) and version D the importance of the likelihood ratio (C: 1/4 versus D: 1/8). {RESULTS}: In version A, 7.5\% concluded that the result was in favour of disease (compatible with p value), 43.6\% ruled against the disease (compatible with likelihood ratio), and 48.9\% were undecided. In version B, 69.0\% were in favour of disease (compatible with likelihood ratio), 4.5\% against (compatible with p value), and 26.5\% undecided.

The objective of this study was to use exploratory factor analysis to describe the correlations among numerous physical and psychological symptoms in terms of a smaller number of unobserved variables or factors. {METHODS}: The Millennium Cohort Study collects extensive self-reported health data from a large, population-based military cohort, providing a unique opportunity to investigate the interrelationships of numerous physical and psychological symptoms among {US} military personnel. This study used data from the Millennium Cohort Study, a large, population-based military cohort. Exploratory factor analysis was used to examine the covariance structure of symptoms reported by approximately 50,000 cohort members during 2004-2006. Analyses incorporated 89 symptoms, including responses to several validated instruments embedded in the questionnaire. Techniques accommodated the categorical and sometimes incomplete nature of the survey data. {RESULTS}: A 14-factor model accounted for 60 percent of the total variance in symptoms data and included factors related to several physical, psychological, and behavioral constructs. A notable finding was that many factors appeared to load in accordance with symptom co-location within the survey instrument, highlighting the difficulty in disassociating the effects of question content, location, and response format on factor structure. {CONCLUSIONS}: This study demonstrates the potential strengths and weaknesses of exploratory factor analysis to heighten understanding of the complex associations among symptoms.

In critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit ({ICU}), such models also appear to be of interest in the investigation of the effect of treatment on severity scores due to the likely association between the longitudinal score and the dropout process, either caused by deaths or live discharges from the {ICU}. However, in this competing risk setting, only cause-specific hazard sub-models for the multiple failure types data have been used. {METHODS}: We propose a joint model that consists of a linear mixed effects submodel for the longitudinal outcome, and a proportional subdistribution hazards submodel for the competing risks survival data, linked together by latent random effects. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo technique of Gibbs sampling to estimate the joint posterior distribution of the unknown parameters of the model. The proposed method is studied and compared to joint model with cause-specific hazards submodel in simulations and applied to a data set that consisted of repeated measurements of severity score and time of discharge and death for 1,401 {ICU} patients. "{RESULTS}: Time by treatment interaction was observed on the evolution of the mean {SOFA} score when ignoring potentially informative dropouts due to {ICU} deaths and live discharges from the {ICU}. In contrast, this was no longer significant when modeling the cause-specific hazards of informative dropouts. Such a time by treatment interaction persisted together with an evidence of treatment effect on the hazard of death when modeling dropout processes through the use of the Fine and Gray model for sub-distribution hazards.{CONCLUSIONS}:In the joint modeling of competing risks with longitudinal response, differences in the handling of competing risk outcomes appear to translate into the estimated difference in treatment effect on the longitudinal outcome. Such a modeling strategy should be carefully defined prior to analysis.},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{OBJECTIVES}: A recent joint report from the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Engineering, highlights the benefits of--indeed, the need for--mathematical analysis of healthcare delivery. Tools for such analysis have been developed over decades by researchers in Operations Research ({OR}). An {OR} perspective typically frames a complex problem in terms of its essential mathematical structure. This article illustrates the use and value of the tools of operations research in healthcare. It reviews one {OR} tool, queueing theory, and provides an illustration involving a hypothetical drug treatment facility. {METHOD}: Queueing Theory ({QT}) is the study of waiting lines. The theory is useful in that it provides solutions to problems of waiting and its relationship to key characteristics of healthcare systems. More generally, it illustrates the strengths of modeling in healthcare and service delivery. Queueing theory offers insights that initially may be hidden. For example, a queueing model allows one to incorporate randomness, which is inherent in the actual system, into the mathematical analysis. As a result of this randomness, these systems often perform much worse than one might have guessed based on deterministic conditions. Poor performance is reflected in longer lines, longer waits, and lower levels of server utilization.As an illustration, we specify a queueing model of a representative drug treatment facility. The analysis of this model provides mathematical expressions for some of the key performance measures, such as average waiting time for admission. {RESULTS}: We calculate average occupancy in the facility and its relationship to system characteristics. For example, when the facility has 28 beds, the average wait for admission is 4 days. We also explore the relationship between arrival rate at the facility, the capacity of the facility, and waiting times. {CONCLUSIONS}: One key aspect of the healthcare system is its complexity, and policy makers want to design and reform the system in a way that affects competing goals. {OR} methodologies, particularly queueing theory, can be very useful in gaining deeper understanding of this complexity and exploring the potential effects of proposed changes on the system without making any actual changes."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Malaria remains a burden in Sub-Saharan Countries. The strategy proposed by the World Health Organization ({WHO}) is to systematically compare the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drugs using as primary outcome for efficacy, a four-category ordered criterion. The objective of the present work was to analyze the treatment effects on this primary outcome taking into account both a center-effect and individual covariates. A three-arm, three-centre trial of Amodiaquine ({AQ}), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ({SP}) and their combination ({AQ} + {SP}), conducted by {OCEAC}-{IRD} in 2003, in 538 children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, is used as an illustration. {METHODS}: Analyses were based on ordinal regression methods, assuming an underlying continuous latent variable, using either the proportional odds ({PO}) or the proportional hazards ({PH}) models. Different algorithms, corresponding to both frequentist- and bayesian-approaches, were implemented using the freely available softwares R and Winbugs, respectively. The performances of the different methods were evaluated on a simulated data set, and then they were applied on the trial data set. {RESULTS}: Good coverage probability and type-1 error for the treatment effect were achieved. When the methods were applied on the trial data set, results highlighted a significance decrease of {SP} efficacy when compared to {AQ} ({PO}, odds ratio [{OR}] 0.14, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.04-0.57; hazard ratio [{HR}] 0.605, 95\% {CI} 0.42-0.82), and an equal effectiveness between {AQ} + {SP} and {AQ} ({PO}, odds ratio [{OR}] 1.70, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.25-11.44; hazard ratio [{HR}] 1.40, 95\% {CI} 0.88-2.18). The body temperature was significantly related to the responses. The patient weights were marginally associated to the clinical response. {CONCLUSION}: The proposed analyses, based on usual statistical packages, appeared adapted to take into account the full information contained in the four categorical outcome in malaria trials, as defined by {WHO}, with the possibility of adjusting on individual and global covariates."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: In 2004, a review of pilot studies published in seven major medical journals during 2000-01 recommended that the statistical analysis of such studies should be either mainly descriptive or focus on sample size estimation, while results from hypothesis testing must be interpreted with caution. We revisited these journals to see whether the subsequent recommendations have changed the practice of reporting pilot studies. We also conducted a survey to identify the methodological components in registered research studies which are described as 'pilot' or 'feasibility' studies. We extended this survey to grant-awarding bodies and editors of medical journals to discover their policies regarding the function and reporting of pilot studies. {METHODS}: Papers from 2007-08 in seven medical journals were screened to retrieve published pilot studies. Reports of registered and completed studies on the {UK} Clinical Research Network ({UKCRN}) Portfolio database were retrieved and scrutinized. Guidance on the conduct and reporting of pilot studies was retrieved from the websites of three grant giving bodies and seven journal editors were canvassed. {RESULTS}: 54 pilot or feasibility studies published in 2007-8 were found, of which 26 (48\%) were pilot studies of interventions and the remainder feasibility studies. The majority incorporated hypothesis-testing (81\%), a control arm (69\%) and a randomization procedure (62\%). Most (81\%) pointed towards the need for further research. Only 8 out of 90 pilot studies identified by the earlier review led to subsequent main studies. Twelve studies which were interventional pilot/feasibility studies and which included testing of some component of the research process were identified through the {UKCRN} Portfolio database. There was no clear distinction in use of the terms 'pilot' and 'feasibility'. Five journal editors replied to our entreaty. In general they were loathe to publish studies described as 'pilot'. {CONCLUSION}: Pilot studies are still poorly reported, with inappropriate emphasis on hypothesis-testing. Authors should be aware of the different requirements of pilot studies, feasibility studies and main studies and report them appropriately. Authors should be explicit as to the purpose of a pilot study. The definitions of feasibility and pilot studies vary and we make proposals here to clarify terminology."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: High accrual to clinical trials enables new treatment strategies to be tested rapidly, accurately and with generalisability. Ethical standards also must be high so that participation is voluntary and informed. However, this can be difficult to achieve in trials with complex designs and those which are closely embedded in clinical practice. Optimal recruitment requires a balance of both ethical and accrual considerations. In the context of a trial of stratified treatments for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ({UKALL}2003) we examined how recruitment looked to an observer and how it felt to the parents, to identify how doctors' communication could promote or inhibit optimal recruitment. {METHODS}: We audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed routine doctor-patient consultations (n=20) and interviews between researchers and parents (n=30 parents) across six {UK} treatment centres. Analysis was informed by the constant comparative method. For consultation transcripts analysis focussed on how doctors presented the trial. We compared this with analysis of the interview transcripts which focussed on parents' perceptions and understanding of the trial. {RESULTS}: Parents and doctors discussed the trial in the majority of consultations, even in those that did not involve making a decision about randomisation. Doctors used language allying them both with the trial and with the parent, indicating that they were both an 'investigator' and a 'clinician. They presented the trial both as an empirical study with a scientific imperative and also as offering personalisation of treatment for the child. Parents appeared to understand that trial involvement was voluntary, that it was different from routine care and that they could withdraw from the trial at any time. Some were confused about the significance of the {MRD} test and the personalisation of treatment. {CONCLUSIONS}: Doctors communicated in ways that generally promoted optimal recruitment indicating that trials can be embedded into clinical practice. However, parents were unclear about some particular details of the trial's rationale suggesting that recruitment to trials with complicated designs, such as those involving stratified treatments, might need enhanced explanation."},

	abstract = {Description: I got this book out of a sense of obligation. It sounded like a book that would be a bore to read, but something important enough that it would be worth reading anyway. I was wrong. The story was quite compelling. There were four stories, actually. The first is the story about the life of Henrietta Lacks, a young woman and mother of five children who died at a young age from a very aggressive cervical cancer. The second is the story of a cell line derived from the biopsy of this woman's tumor (taken without her permission or knowledge. This cell line, known as {HeLa}, was the first immortal human cell line developed. The {HeLa} cells played a unique role in much of the work involving development of the polio vaccine and in many other scientific developments over the past five decades. The third story is about the people in the laboratory that developed the {HeLa} cell line and what they did differently from other scientists at the time that helped develop the {HeLa} cell line. The fourth story is about the surviving children of Henrietta Lacks, how they were abused and taken advantage of by the same scientists that took Henrietta Lack's tumor sample without her knowledge, and how they dealt with the anger over this abuse. The fifth story is about how the author, Rebecca Skloot, worked to gain the trust of the Lacks family, who were justifiably anxious about strangers showing up and asking lots of questions. These stories are all interwoven and are told with a masterful sense of their interdependence.},

The book is intended as an upper level undergraduate or introductory graduate textbook in statistical thinking with a likelihood emphasis for students with a good knowledge of calculus and the ability to think abstractly. By "statistical thinking" is meant a focus on ideas that statisticians care about as opposed to technical details of how to put those ideas into practice.

Purpose: To assess how often investigators specify the composition of placebos in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Data Sources: 4 English-language general and internal medicine journals with high impact factors. Study Selection: 3 reviewers screened titles and abstracts of the journals to identify randomized, placebo-controlled trials published from January 2008 to December 2009. Data Extraction: Reviewers independently abstracted data from the introduction and methods sections of identified articles, recording treatment type (pill, injection, or other) and whether placebo composition was stated. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Data Synthesis: Most studies did not disclose the composition of the study placebo. Disclosure was less common for pills than for injections and other treatments (8.2\% vs. 26.7\%; P = 0.002). Limitation: Journals with high impact factors may not be representative. Conclusion: Placebos were seldom described in randomized, controlled trials of pills or capsules. Because the nature of the placebo can influence trial outcomes, placebo formulation should be disclosed in reports of placebo-controlled trials.

The treated and non-treated (that is, control) groups may have large differences on their observed covariates, and these differences can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects. Even traditional covariance analysis adjustments may be inadequate to eliminate this bias. The propensity score, defined as the conditional probability of being treated given the covariates, can be used to balance the covariates in the two groups, and therefore reduce this bias. In order to estimate the propensity score, one must model the distribution of the treatment indicator variable given the observed covariates. Once estimated the propensity score can be used to reduce bias through matching, stratification (subclassification), regression adjustment, or some combination of all three. In this tutorial we discuss the uses of propensity score methods for bias reduction, give references to the literature and illustrate the uses through applied examples."},
