	abstract = {Excerpt: "Summary

Before approving a new drug, the Food and Drug Administration ({FDA})--an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services ({HHS})--assesses a drug's effectiveness. To do so, it examines information contained in a new drug application ({NDA}), including data from clinical trials in humans. Several types of trials may be used to gather this evidence. For example, superiority trials may show that a new drug is more effective than an active control--a drug known to be effective. Non-inferiority trials aim to demonstrate that the difference between the effectiveness of a new drug and an active control is small--small enough to show that the new drug is also effective. Drugs approved on this basis may provide important benefits, such as improved safety. Because non-inferiority trials are difficult to design and interpret, they have received attention within the research community and {FDA}. {FDA} has issued guidance on these trials. {GAO} was asked to examine {FDA}'s use of non-inferiority trial evidence. This report (1) identifies {NDAs} for new molecular entities--potentially innovative new drugs not {FDA}-approved in any form--that included evidence from non-inferiority trials, (2) examines the characteristics of these trials, and (3) describes {FDA}'s guidance on these trials. {GAO} reviewed {NDAs} submitted to {FDA} between fiscal year 2002 (the first full year that {FDA} documentation was available electronically) and fiscal year 2009 (the last full year of submissions), examined {FDA}'s guidance, and interviewed agency officials."},
