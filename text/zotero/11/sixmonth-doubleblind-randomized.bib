Methods: In this 24-week, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled trial, patients with probable {AD} were randomized to one of four treatment groups: 12<U+2009>mg/day rivastigmine capsules; 10<U+2009>cm2 (9.5<U+2009>mg/24<U+2009>h) rivastigmine patch; 20<U+2009>cm2 (17.4<U+2009>mg/24<U+2009>h) rivastigmine patch; or placebo. Primary efficacy measures were the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale<U+0097>Cognitive subscale ({ADAS}-Cog) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study<U+0096><U+0096>Clinical Global Impression of Change ({ADCS}-{CGIC}). Results: One thousand one hundred and ninety five {AD} patients from 21 countries participated in the study. Treatment differences (vs placebo) on the {ADAS}-Cog at Week 24 in 10<U+2009>cm2 patch, 20<U+2009>cm2 patch and capsule groups were 1.6 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005), 2.6 (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and 1.6 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003). Treatment differences on the {ADCS}-{CGIC} were 0.3 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01), 0.2 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.054) and 0.3 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.009). Comparison between the 10<U+2009>cm2 patch and the capsule revealed non-inferiority. Rates of nausea in the 10<U+2009>cm2 patch and capsule groups were 7.2% and 23.1%, respectively; rates of vomiting were 6.2% and 17.0%, respectively. Moderate or severe skin irritation occurred in =10% patients across the four patch sizes (5, 10, 15 and 20<U+2009>cm2). Conclusions: The target dose of 10<U+2009>cm2 rivastigmine patch provides efficacy similar to the highest doses of capsules with a superior tolerability profile. The transdermal patch with rivastigmine may offer convenience important to many caregivers and patients. Keywords: Alzheimer's disease; patch;   rivastigmine; transdermal"},
