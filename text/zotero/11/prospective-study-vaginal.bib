	abstract = {Trichomonas vaginalis has been associated with increased vaginal {HIV}-1 {RNA} shedding in antiretroviral therapy ({ART})-na√Øve women. The effect of trichomoniasis on vaginal {HIV}-1 shedding in {ART}-treated women has not been characterized. We tested the hypothesis that T. vaginalis infection would increase vaginal {HIV}-1 {RNA} shedding in women on {ART}, and that successful treatment would reduce vaginal {HIV}-1 {RNA} levels.},
