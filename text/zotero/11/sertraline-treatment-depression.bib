	abstract = {Abstract: "{OBJECTIVE}: Depression is common in Alzheimer disease ({AD}), and antidepressants are commonly used for its treatment, however, evidence for antidepressant efficacy in this population is lacking. The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial titled "Depression in Alzheimer's Disease-2" to assess the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline for depression in {AD}. {METHODS}: One hundred thirty-one participants from five U.S. medical centers with mild-to-moderate {AD} (Mini-Mental State Examination scores 10-26) and depression of {AD} were randomized to double-blinded treatment with sertraline (N = 67) or placebo (N = 64), with a target dosage of 100 mg daily. Efficacy was assessed using logistic regressions and mixed effects models in an intention-to-treat analysis with imputation of missing data. Principal outcome measures were modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change ({mADCS}-{CGIC}), change in Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia ({CSDD}) scores, and remission defined by both {mADCS}-{CGIC} score <or=2 and {CSDD} score <or=6. {RESULTS}: {mADCS}-{CGIC} ratings (odd ratio [{OR} = 1.01], 95% confidence interval [{CI}]: 0.52-1.97, p = 0.98), {CSDD} scores (median difference at 12 weeks 1.2, 95% {CI}: 1.65-4.05, p = 0.41), and remission at 12 weeks of follow-up ({OR} = 2.06, 95% {CI}: 0.84-5.04, p = 0.11) did not differ between sertraline (N = 67) and placebo (N = 64). Sertraline-treated patients experienced more adverse events, most notably gastrointestinal and respiratory, than placebo-treated patients. {CONCLUSION}: Sertraline did not demonstrate efficacy for the treatment depression symptoms in patients with {AD}. In addition, its use was associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. Thus, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be of limited value for treating depression in patients with {AD}."},
