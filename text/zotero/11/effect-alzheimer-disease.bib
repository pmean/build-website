	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Genetic susceptibility testing for Alzheimer disease ({AD}) with {APOE} genotype disclosure is not recommended for clinical use but is available through direct-to-consumer ({DTC}) genetic testing companies. Little is known about whether {APOE} genotype disclosure would actually prompt changes in nutrition behaviors among at-risk individuals. {OBJECTIVE}: We studied the effect of {APOE} genotype disclosure for {AD} risk assessment on dietary supplement use in adults with a family history of {AD}. {DESIGN}: As part of a secondary analysis of data from the second Risk Evaluation and Education for Alzheimer's Disease Study, we examined the effect of genotype disclosure on health-behavior changes among 272 unaffected first-degree relatives of persons with {AD}. {RESULTS}: Overall, 16% of all participants reported a change in dietary supplement use after {AD} risk assessment. Participants who learned that they had at least one copy of the risk-increasing epsilon4 allele (epsilon4+) had 4.75 times the odds of reporting a change in dietary supplement use than did their counterparts who had an absence of the risk-increasing epsilon4 allele (epsilon4-) (95% {CI}: 2.23, 10.10; P < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, race, baseline supplement use, randomization arm, and educational level. There were no significant differences between {APOE} epsilon4+ and epsilon4- participants in changes in overall diet, exercise, or medications. {CONCLUSIONS}: In this sample of first-degree relatives receiving genetic susceptibility testing for {AD}, an {APOE} epsilon4+ genotype status was positively associated with dietary supplement use after risk disclosure. Such changes occurred despite the absence of evidence that supplement use reduces the risk of {AD}. Given the expansion of {DTC} genetic tests, this study highlights the need for future studies in disease risk communication."},
