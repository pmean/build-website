	abstract = {Description: An excellent overview of the limitations of Epidemiological research, illustrated by the perplexing findings about the link (or lack thereof) between cell phone use and brain cancer. My only complaint is that they did not address how difficult it is to decide when to close the door on further research. How many negative studies can you tolerate before you say, "Enough! Let's move on to something else."},
