	abstract = {Excerpt: "I have been intrigued by Bonferroni for some time. His inequalities are widely known, but his life and works are not. I have recently submitted an article for publication in an attempt to rectify this situation, and have also published a short biography in the recent Encyclopaedia of Biostatistics published by Wiley. Links from this page give some information about him. I have also prepared a bibliography of his works which extends the published ones by including volume and page references for most of the articles. The bibliography is also available in {BibTex} format, which I think should be self explanatory if you use a different reference manager. "},
