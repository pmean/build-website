	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: {MAGE}-{ML} has been promoted as a standard format for describing microarray experiments and the data they produce. Two characteristics of the {MAGE}-{ML} format compromise its use as a universal standard: First, {MAGE}-{ML} files are exceptionally large - too large to be easily read by most people, and often too large to be read by most software programs. Second, the {MAGE}-{ML} standard permits many ways of representing the same information. As a result, different producers of {MAGE}-{ML} create different documents describing the same experiment and its data. Recognizing all the variants is an unwieldy software engineering task, resulting in software packages that can read and process {MAGE}-{ML} from some, but not all producers. This Tower of {MAGE}-{ML} Babel bars the unencumbered exchange of microarray experiment descriptions couched in {MAGE}-{ML}. {RESULTS}: We have developed {XBabelPhish} - an {XQuery}-based technology for translating one {MAGE}-{ML} variant into another. {XBabelPhish}'s use is not restricted to translating {MAGE}-{ML} documents. It can transform {XML} files independent of their {DTD}, {XML} schema, or semantic content. Moreover, it is designed to work on very large (> 200 Mb.) files, which are common in the world of {MAGE}-{ML}. {CONCLUSION}: {XBabelPhish} provides a way to inter-translate {MAGE}-{ML} variants for improved interchange of microarray experiment information. More generally, it can be used to transform most {XML} files, including very large ones that exceed the capacity of most {XML} tools."},
