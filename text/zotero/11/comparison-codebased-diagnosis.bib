	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}:  {BACKGROUND}: Administrative health databases are a valuable research tool to assess health care utilization at the population level. However, their use in obesity research limited due to the lack of data on body weight. A potential workaround is to use the {ICD} code of obesity to identify obese individuals. The objective of the current study was to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of an {ICD} code-based diagnosis of obesity from administrative health data relative to the gold standard measured {BMI}. {METHODS}: Linkage of a population-based survey with anthropometric measures in elementary school children in 2003 with longitudinal administrative health data (physician visits and hospital discharges 1992-2006) from the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Measured obesity was defined based on the {CDC} cut-offs applied to the measured {BMI}. An {ICD} code-based diagnosis obesity was defined as one or more {ICD}-9 (278) or {ICD}-10 code (E66-E68) of obesity from a physician visit or a hospital stay. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and health care cost estimates based on measured obesity and {ICD}-based obesity were compared. {RESULTS}: The sensitivity of an {ICD} code-based obesity diagnosis was 7.4% using {ICD} codes between 2002 and 2004. Those correctly identified had a higher {BMI} and had higher health care utilization and costs. {CONCLUSIONS}: An {ICD} diagnosis of obesity in Canadian administrative health data grossly underestimates the true prevalence of childhood obesity and overestimates the health care cost differential between obese and non-obese children.},
