	abstract = {Abstract: "Both, Open Innovation and Web 2.0, are concepts used in commerce in order to support the collaboration of di⬚erent people and the emergence of new ideas. The approaches can be adapted to science, thus o⬚ering new opportunities for research and education. If necessary requirements are satis⬚ed, Open Science 2.0 facilitates e.g. the public development of scienti⬚c papers and the conduct of public seminars, both harnessing collective intelligence. This way, it is not only possible to improve the individual outcomes, but also to encourage the exchange between theory and practice."},
