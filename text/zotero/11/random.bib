It is still used in some research studies as a method of randomization, although it has largely been discredited as a valid randomization method. We sought to provide evidence that the toss of a coin can be manipulated. Methods: We performed a prospective experiment involving otolaryngology residents in Vancouver, Canada. The main outcome was the proportion of <U+0093>heads<U+0094> coin tosses achieved (out of 300 attempts) by each participant. Each of the participants attempted to flip the coin so as to achieve a heads result. Results: All participants achieved more heads than tails results, with 7 of the 13 participants having significantly more heads results (p = 0.05). The highest proportion of heads achieved was 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.62<U+0096>0.73, p < 0.001).Interpretation: Certain people are able to successfully manipulate the toss of a coin. This throws into doubt the validity of using a coin toss to determine a chance result."},
