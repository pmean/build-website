	abstract = {Abstract: "Results of subgroup analysis ({SA}) reported in randomized clinical trials ({RCT}) cannot be adequately interpreted without information about the methods used in the study design and the data analysis. Our aim was to show how often inaccurate or incomplete reports occur. First, we selected eight methodological aspects of {SA} on the basis of their importance to a reader in determining the confidence that should be placed in the author's conclusions regarding such analysis. Then, we reviewed the current practice of reporting these methodological aspects of {SA} in clinical trials in four leading journals, i.e., the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Lancet, and the American Journal of Public Health. Eight consecutive reports from each journal published after July 1, 1998 were included. Of the 32 trials surveyed, 17 (53\%) had at least one {SA}. Overall, the proportion of {RCT} reporting a particular methodological aspect ranged from 23 to 94\%. Information on whether the {SA} preceded/followed the analysis was reported in only 7 (41\%) of the studies. Of the total possible number of items to be reported, {NEJM}, {JAMA}, Lancet and {AJPH} clearly mentioned 59, 67, 58 and 72\%, respectively. We conclude that current reporting of {SA} in {RCT} is incomplete and inaccurate. The results of such {SA} may have harmful effects on treatment recommendations if accepted without judicious scrutiny. We recommend that editors improve the reporting of {SA} in {RCT} by giving authors a list of the important items to be reported."},
