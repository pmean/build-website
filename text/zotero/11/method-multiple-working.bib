	abstract = {Excerpt: "This essay on methods of scientific thought appeared in the Journal of Geology, Volume V (1897), pages 837-48 under the heading, "Studies for Students." Since then it has come to be regarded by many as a classic of its kind and its influence has been far-reaching. Requests for copies of it are still frequently received, although the available supply was exhausted many years ago. In response to the continued demand and in the belief that the present generation should be familiar with it, this study for students is reprinted in its original form."},
