As they acknowledge their equations (17) to (19) are derived from Donner and Klar (200). I would like to point out the issue of fixed number of clusters was also discussed by Campbell (2000) that the authors<U+0092> equation (13) was first given as equation (2) in that paper and as equation (9.7) in Machin and Campbell (2005).
