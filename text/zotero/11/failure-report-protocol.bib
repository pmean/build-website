	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: "{BACKGROUND}: Excessive protocol violations ({PV}), which can be defined as preventable mistakes in study conduct, may result in patient harm and introduce errors into a clinical trial's results leading to flawed trial conclusions.  The purpose of this project was to gain a better understanding of reported {PVs}, to describe current practice with regards to the use of methods for the reduction of {PVs} and to investigate relationships between clinical trial characteristics and {PVs}. {METHODS}: We reviewed 80 clinical trials conducted across a broad range of medical specialties published in four major general medical journals (The Lancet, {NEJM}, {JAMA}, {BMJ}). Eligible papers were identified using a {PubMed} search. For each included trial, two authors independently abstracted information on trial characteristics, {PV} reporting and {PV} rates and interventions used to reduce {PVs}. {PVs} were categorised into one of five distinct types: enrolment, randomisation, study intervention, patient compliance and data collection errors. Associations between {PVs} and study characteristics were investigated using logistic regression. {RESULTS}: Eighty clinical trials (20 from each journal) were identified from 101 consecutive {PubMed} abstracts. The median number of participants was 701 (range: 20 to 162,367) and the median number of participating sites was 15 (range: 1 to 701). Nineteen percent (15/80) of included trials were single centre trials. The median study duration was 24 months (range: 5.81 - 127 months) and 74\% (59/80) of included trials were primarily academic funded. Thirty two percent (26/80) of included trials failed to provide explicit reporting of any type of {PV} and none (0/80) of the trials provided explicit reporting of all five types of {PVs}. Larger clinical trials (more patients, more sites, longer duration, more complex management structure) were more likely to have more complete reporting of {PV}'s.  Only 9\% (7/80) of trials reported the use of a specific study method to prevent {PVs}. Use of a run-in phase was the only method reported.  {CONCLUSIONS}: {PVs} are under-reported. Although the {CONSORT} statement provides guidance on the reporting of {PVs}, reporting requirements are not explicit for all types of {PVs}. As a first step towards improved reporting by authors, we recommend the {CONSORT} statement highlight the importance of {PVs} by making reporting requirements more explicit."},
