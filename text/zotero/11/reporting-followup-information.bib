	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: To assess the reporting of loss to follow-up ({LTFU}) information in articles on randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}) with time-to-event outcomes, and to assess whether discrepancies affect the validity of study results. {METHODS}: Literature survey of all issues of the {BMJ}, Lancet, {JAMA}, and New England Journal of Medicine published between 2003 and 2005. Eligible articles were reports of {RCTs} including at least one Kaplan-Meier plot. Articles were classified as "assessable" if sufficient information was available to assess {LTFU}. In these articles, {LTFU} information was derived from Kaplan-Meier plots, extracted from the text, and compared. Articles were then classified as "consistent" or "not consistent". Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the validity of study results. {RESULTS}: 319 eligible articles were identified. 187 (59%) were classified as "assessable", as they included sufficient information for evaluation; 140 of 319 (44%) presented consistent {LTFU} information between the Kaplan-Meier plot and text. 47 of 319 (15%) were classified as "not consistent". These 47 articles were included in sensitivity analyses. When various imputation methods were used, the results of a chi2-test applied to the corresponding 2 <d7> 2 table changed and hence were not robust in about half of the studies. {CONCLUSIONS}: Less than half of the articles on {RCTs} using Kaplan-Meier plots provide assessable and consistent {LTFU} information, thus questioning the validity of the results and conclusions of many studies presenting survival analyses. Authors should improve the presentation of both Kaplan-Meier plots and {LTFU} information, and reviewers of study publications and journal editors should critically appraise the validity of the information provided."},
