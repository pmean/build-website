To augment the statement we published the {CONSORT} explanation and elaboration paper which included at least one example of good reporting for each {CONSORT} checklist item. We are developing a comprehensive database of examples of good reporting for each checklist item to take advantage of the breadth and variety of trials familiar to authors and readers globally. We invite authors, editors, and readers worldwide to nominate examples of well reported items for the database."},
