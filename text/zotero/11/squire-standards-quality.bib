	abstract = {Abstract: "As the science of quality improvement in health care advances, the importance of sharing its accomplishments through the published literature increases. Current reporting of improvement work in health care varies widely in both content and quality. It is against this backdrop that a group of stakeholders from a variety of disciplines has created the Standards for {QUality} Improvement Reporting Excellence, which we refer to as the {SQUIRE} publication guidelines or {SQUIRE} statement. The {SQUIRE} statement consists of a checklist of 19 items that authors need to consider when writing articles that describe formal studies of quality improvement. Most of the items in the checklist are common to all scientific reporting, but virtually all of them have been modified to reflect the unique nature of medical improvement work. This <U+FFFD>Explanation and Elaboration<U+FFFD> document (E & E) is a companion to the {SQUIRE} statement. For each item in the {SQUIRE} guidelines the E & E document provides one or two examples from the published improvement literature, followed by an analysis of the ways in which the example expresses the intent of the guideline item. As with the E & E documents created to accompany other biomedical publication guidelines, the purpose of the {SQUIRE} E & E document is to assist authors along the path from completion of a quality improvement project to its publication. The {SQUIRE} statement itself, this E & E document, and additional information about reporting improvement work can be found at http://www.squire-statement.org."},
