	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}:  {BACKGROUND}: Over the last decade there have been a number of guidelines published, aimed at improving the quality of reporting in published studies and reviews. In systematic reviews this may be measured by their compliance with the {PRISMA} statement. This review aims to evaluate the quality of reporting in published meta-analyses of diagnostic tests, using the {PRISMA} statement and establish whether there has been a measurable improvement over time. {METHODS}: Eight databases were searched for reviews published prior to 31st December 2008. Studies were selected if they evaluated a diagnostic test, measured performance, searched two or more databases, stated the search terms and inclusion criteria, and used a statistical method to summarise a test's performance. Data were extracted on the review characteristics and items of the {PRISMA} statement. To measure the change in the quality of reporting over time, {PRISMA} items for two periods of equal duration were compared. {RESULTS}: Compliance with the {PRISMA} statement was generally poor: none of the reviews completely adhered to all 27 checklist items. Of the 236 meta-analyses included following selection: only 2(1%) reported the study protocol; 59(25%) reported the searches used; 76(32%) reported the results of a risk of bias assessment; and 82(35%) reported the abstract as a structured summary. Only 11 studies were published before 2000. Thus, the impact of {QUOROM} on the quality of reporting was not evaluated. . However, the periods 2001-2004 and 2005-2008 (covering 93% of studies) were compared using relative risks ({RR}). There was an increase in the proportion of reviews reporting on five {PRISMA} items: eligibility criteria ({RR} 1.13, 95% {CI} 1.00 - 1.27); risk of bias across studies (methods) ({RR} 1.81, 95% {CI} 1.34 - 2.44); study selection results ({RR} 1.48, 95% {CI} 1.05 - 2.09); results of individual studies ({RR} 1.37, 95% {CI} 1.09 - 1.72); risk of bias across studies (results) ({RR} 1.65, 95% {CI} 1.20 - 2.25).  {CONCLUSION}: Although there has been an improvement in the quality of meta-analyses in diagnostic research, there are still many deficiencies in the reporting which future reviewers need to address if readers are to trust the validity of the reported findings.},
