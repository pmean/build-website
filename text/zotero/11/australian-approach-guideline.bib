	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Clinical practice guidelines have been defined as systematically developed
statements to assist practitioner and patient decision-making about appropriate health care for
specific clinical circumstances. They play an important role in guiding evidence based clinical
practice. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council has developed and pilottested
a new framework for guideline development, the {FORM} approach, the role of which has
yet to be further defined.{METHODS}:We critically review the elements of the {FRAME} approach and compare it to other,
more established methods for rating the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations.{RESULTS}:{FORM} recognizes five factors that impact the strength of a recommendation which are
the evidence base, consistency, clinical impact, generalizability and applicability. Consideration
of these elements leads to a four-tiered rating system represented by the letters A ("body of
evidence can be trusted to guide practice") to D ("body of evidence is weak and
recommendation must be applied with caution"). It builds on other existing guideline
methodologies such as those developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network
({SIGN}), the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy ({SORT}) and the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ({GRADE}) groups. {FORM}
distinguishes itself from other systems by its strong emphasis on applicability, which is
separated out as its own category and relates the relevance of the body of evidence to the
Australian healthcare system.{CONCLUSIONS}:The {FORM} approach offers a methodologically rigorous alternative approach to
guideline development that places particular emphasis on aspects of applicability. This feature
is unique and may prompt future adoption by other guidelines systems},
