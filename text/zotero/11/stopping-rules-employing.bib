	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}:  {BACKGROUND}: Response rate ({RR}), the most common early means of assessing oncology drugs, is not suitable as the sole endpoint for phase {II} trials of drugs which induce disease stability but not regression.  Time to progression ({TTP}) may be more sensitive to such agents, but induces recruitment delays in multistage studies.  Early progressive disease ({EPD}) is the earliest signal of time to progression, but is less intuitive to investigators,    To study drugs with unknown anti-tumour effect, we designed the Combination Stopping Rule ({CSR}), which allows investigators to establish a hypothesis using {RR} and {TTP}, while the program also employs early progressive disease ({EPD}) to assess for drug inactivity during the first stage of study accrual.  {METHODS}: A computer program was created to generate stopping rules based on specified error rates, trial size, and {RR} and median {TTP} of interest and disinterest for a  two-stage phase {II} trial.  Rules were generated for stage {II} such that the null hypothesis (H-nul) was rejected if either {RR} or {TTP} met desired thresholds, and accepted if both did not.  Assuming an exponential distribution for progression, {EPD} thresholds were determined based on specified {TTP} values.  Stopping rules were generated for stage I such that H-nul was accepted and the study stopped if both {RR} and {EPD} were unacceptable.   {RESULTS}: Patient thresholds were generated for {RR}, median {TTP}, and {EPD} which achieved specified error rates and which allowed early stopping based on {RR} and {EPD}.  For smaller proportional differences between interesting and disinteresting values of {RR} or {TTP}, larger trials are required to maintain alpha error, and early stopping is more common with a larger first stage.   {CONCLUSION}: Stopping rules are provided for phase {II} trials for drugs which have either a desirable {RR} or {TTP}.  In addition, early stopping can be achieved using {RR} and {EPD}.},
