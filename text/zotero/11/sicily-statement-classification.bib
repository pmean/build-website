	abstract = {Abstract: " {BACKGROUND}: Teaching the steps of evidence-based practice ({EBP}) has become standard curriculum for health professions at both student and professional levels. Determining the best methods for evaluating {EBP} learning is hampered by a dearth of valid and practical assessment tools and by the absence of guidelines for classifying the purpose of those that exist. Conceived and developed by delegates of the Fifth International Conference of Evidence-Based Health Care Teachers and Developers, the aim of this statement is to provide guidance for purposeful classification and development of tools to assess {EBP} learning. {DISCUSSION}: This paper identifies key principles for designing {EBP} learning assessment tools, recommends a common taxonomy for new and existing tools, and presents the Classification Rubric for {EBP} Assessment Tools in Education ({CREATE}) framework for classifying such tools. Recommendations are provided for developers of {EBP} learning assessments and priorities are suggested for the types of assessments that are needed. Examples place existing {EBP} assessments into the {CREATE} framework to demonstrate how a common taxonomy might facilitate purposeful development and use of {EBP} learning assessment tools. {SUMMARY}: The widespread adoption of {EBP} into professional education requires valid and reliable measures of learning. Limited tools exist with established psychometrics. This international consensus statement strives to provide direction for developers of new {EBP} learning assessment tools and a framework for classifying the purposes of such tools."},
