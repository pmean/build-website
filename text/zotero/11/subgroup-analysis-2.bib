	abstract = {Excerpt: "Surgical practice should principally be based on evidence originating from high-quality data such as randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}). Whereas these studies mostly investigate general and representative patient populations, clinical decisions most often depend on individual patient characteristics. To concede to the need of individually based guidelines, many {RCTs} report analyses on specific subgroups of patients.1,2 The main aim of a subgroup analysis is to identify either consistency of or large differences in the magnitude of treatment effect among different categories of patients. Determining whether the observed overall treatment effect is different across certain subgroups may justly provide some patients with its benefits and protect others from its harm."},
