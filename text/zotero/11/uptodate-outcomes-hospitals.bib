	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Computerized clinical knowledge mana-gement systems hold enormous potential for improving quality and efficiency. However, their impact on clinical practice is not well known. {OBJECTIVE}: To examine the impact of {UpToDate} on outcomes of care. {DESIGN}: Retrospective study. {SETTING}: National sample of {US} inpatient hospitals. {PATIENTS}: Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. {INTERVENTION}: Adoption of {UpToDate} in {US} hospitals. {MEASUREMENT}: Risk-adjusted lengths of stay, mortality rates, and quality performance. {RESULTS}: We found that patients admitted to hospitals using {UpToDate} had shorter lengths of stay than patients admitted to non-{UpToDate} hospitals overall (5.6 days vs 5.7 days; P < 0.001) and among 6 prespecified conditions (range, -0.1 to -0.3 days; P < 0.001 for each). Further, patients admitted to {UpToDate} hospitals had lower risk-adjusted mortality rate for 3 of the 6 conditions (range, -0.1% to -0.6% mortality reduction; P < 0.05). Finally, hospitals with {UpToDate} had better quality performance for every condition on the Hospital Quality Alliance metrics. In subgroup analyses, we found that it was the smaller hospitals and the non-teaching hospitals where the benefits of the {UpToDate} seemed most pronounced, compared to the larger, teaching institutions where the benefits of {UpToDate} seemed small or nonexistent. {CONCLUSIONS}: We found a very small but consistent association between use of {UpToDate} and reduced length of stay, lower risk-adjusted mortality rates, and better quality performance, at least in the smaller, non-teaching institutions. These findings may suggest that computerized tools such as {UpToDate} could be helpful in improving care."},
