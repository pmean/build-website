J. 2001; 35:1517-1527) proposed that the noninferiority ({NI}) margin should be a small fraction of the therapeutic effect of the active control as compared with placebo in the setting of testing the {NI} hypothesis of the mean difference with a continuous outcome. For testing the {NI} hypothesis of the mean ratio with a continuous outcome, a similar {NI} margin on a log scale is proposed. This approach may also be applied in the setting of testing the {NI} hypotheses for survival data based on hazard ratios. Some pitfalls of testing the {NI} hypotheses with binary endpoints based on the difference or the ratio of proportions will be discussed. Testing the {NI} hypothesis with binary endpoints based on the odds ratio is proposed."},
