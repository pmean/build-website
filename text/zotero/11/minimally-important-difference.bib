{ABSTRACT}:


{BACKGROUND}

A previous study has documented the reliability and validity of the Treatment Satisfaction with Medicines Questionnaire ({SATMED}-Q) in exploring patient satisfaction with medicines for chronic health conditions in routine medical practice, but the minimally important difference ({MID}) of this tool is as yet unknown. The objective of this research was to estimate the {MID} for the {SATMED}-Q total score and six constituent domains.


{METHODS}

The sample of patients (456 subjects, mean age 59 years, 53\% male) used for testing psychometric properties was also used to assess {MID}. Item \#14 of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication ({TSQM}) was used as an anchor reference since it directly explores satisfaction with medicine on a 7-point ordinal scale (from extremely satisfied to extremely dissatisfied, with a neutral category). Patients were classified into four categories according to responses to this item (extremely satisfied/dissatisfied, very satisfied/dissatisfied, satisfied/dissatisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied (neutral), and calculations were made for the total score and each domain of the {SATMED}-Q using standardised scores. The mean absolute differences in total score (and domains) between the neutral category and the satisfied/dissatisfied category were considered to be the {MID}. Effect sizes ({ES}) were also computed.


{RESULTS}

The {MID} for the total score was 13.4 ({ES} = 0.91), while the domain values ranged from 10.3 (medical care domain, {ES} = 0.43) to 20.6 (impact on daily living, {ES} = 0.85). Mean differences in satisfaction (as measured by the total {SATMED}-Q score and domain scores) using the levels of satisfaction established by item \#14 were significantly different, with F values ranging from 12.2 to 88.8 (p {\textless} 0.001 in all cases).


{CONCLUSION}

The {SATMED}-Q was demonstrated to be responsive to different levels of patient satisfaction with therapy in chronically ill subjects. The {MID} obtained was 13.4 points for the overall normalised scoring scale, and between 10.3 and 20.6 points for domains.},
