	abstract = {Proving that research findings from in vitro or animal models are relevant to human diseases is a major bottleneck in medical science. Hundreds of researchers have suggested the human relevance of oncogenic mechanisms from the statistical association between gene expression markers of these mechanisms and disease outcome. Such evidence has become easier to obtain recently with the advent of microarray screens and of large public-domain genome-wide expression datasets with patient follow-up. We demonstrated that in breast cancer any set of 100 genes or more selected at random has a 90% chance to be significantly associated with outcome. Thus, investigators are bound to find an association however whimsical their marker is. For example, we could establish outcome associations for a signature of postprandial laughter and a signature of social defeat in mice. Association was not stronger than expected at random for 28 (60%) of 47 published breast cancer signatures. The odds of association are 5<U+0096>17% with random single gene markers<U+0097>a finding relevant to older breast cancer studies. We explained these results by showing that much of the breast cancer transcriptome is correlated with proliferation, which integrates most prognostic information in this disease.},
