	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Personal digital assistants ({PDA}) offer putative advantages over paper for collecting research data. However, there are no data prospectively comparing {PDA} and paper in the emergency department. The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the performance of {PDA} and paper enrollment instruments with respect to time required and errors generated. {METHODS}: We randomized consecutive patients enrolled in an ongoing prospective study to having their data recorded either on a {PDA} or a paper data collection instrument. For each method, we recorded the total time required for enrollment, and the time required for manual transcription (paper) onto a computer database. We compared data error rates by examining missing data, nonsensical data, and errors made during the transcription of paper forms. Statistical comparisons were performed by Kruskal-Wallis and Poisson regression analyses for time and errors, respectively. {RESULTS}: We enrolled 68 patients (37 {PDA}, 31 paper). Two of 31 paper forms were not available for analysis. Total data gathering times, inclusive of transcription, were significantly less for {PDA} (6:13 min per patient) compared to paper (9:12 min per patient; p < 0.001). There were a total of 0.9 missing and nonsense errors per paper form compared to 0.2 errors per {PDA} form (p < 0.001). An additional 0.7 errors per paper form were generated during transcription. In total, there were 1.6 errors per paper form and 0.2 errors per {PDA} form (p < 0.001). {CONCLUSION}: Using a {PDA}-based data collection instrument for clinical research reduces the time required for data gathering and significantly improves data integrity."},
