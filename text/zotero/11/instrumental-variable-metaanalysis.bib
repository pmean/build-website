	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Intention-to-treat ({ITT}) is the standard data analysis method which includes all patients regardless of receiving treatment. Although the aim of {ITT} analysis is to prevent bias due to prognostic dissimilarity, it is also a counter-intuitive type of analysis as it counts patients who did not receive treatment, and may lead to "bias toward the null." As treated ({AT}) method analyzes patients according to the treatment actually received rather than intended, but is affected by the selection bias. Both {ITT} and {AT} analyses can produce biased estimates of treatment effect, so instrumental variable ({IV}) analysis has been proposed as a technique to control for bias when using {AT} data. Our objective is to correct for bias in non-experimental data from previously published individual patient data meta-analysis by applying {IV} methods. {METHODS}: Center prescribing preference was used as an {IV} to assess the effects of methotrexate ({MTX}) in preventing debilitating complications of chronic graft-versus-host-disease ({cGVHD}) in patients who received peripheral blood stem cell ({PBSCT}) or bone marrow transplant ({BMT}) in nine randomized controlled trials (1107 patients). {IV} methods are applied using 2-stage logistic, 2-stage probit and generalized method of moments models. {RESULTS}: {ITT} analysis showed a statistically significant detrimental effect with the use of day 11 {MTX}, resulting in {cGVHD} odds ratio ({OR}) of 1.34 (95% {CI} 1.02-1.76). {AT} results showed no difference in the odds of {cGVHD} with the use of {MTX} [{OR} 1.31 (95%{CI} 0.99-1.73)]. {IV} analysis further corrected the results toward no difference in the odds of {cGVHD} between {PBSCT} vs. {BMT}, allowing for a possibility of beneficial effects of {MTX} in preventing {cGVHD} in {PBSCT} recipients ({OR} 1.14; 95%{CI} 0.83-1.56). {CONCLUSION}: All instrumental variable models produce similar results. {IV} estimates correct for bias and do not exclude the possibility that {MTX} may be beneficial, contradicting the {ITT} analysis."},
