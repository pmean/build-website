	abstract = {Excerpt: "Without clear evidence to guide us and needing to make a decision swiftly, we turned to a new approach, using the data captured in our institution's electronic medical record ({EMR}) and an innovative research data warehouse. The platform, called the Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment ({STRIDE}), acquires and stores all patient data contained in the {EMR} at our hospital and provides immediate advanced text searching capability.1 Through {STRIDE}, we could rapidly review data on an {SLE} cohort that included pediatric patients with {SLE} cared for by clinicians in our division between October 2004 and July 2009. This “electronic cohort" was originally created for use in studying complications associated with pediatric {SLE} and exists under a protocol approved by our institutional review board."},
