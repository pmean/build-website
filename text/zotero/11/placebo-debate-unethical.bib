	abstract = {Excerpt: "You might wonder, lately, if placebos can confer genuine health benefits to some people with illness. If you're reviewing a serious publication like the New England Journal of Medicine, you could be persuaded by results of a recent article on giving placebos to asthma patients in a randomized clinical trial. The topic has blossomed since 2008, when {PLoS} One reported on the use of mock treatments, without concealment, in people with irritable bowel syndrome. In that small study, participants experienced symptomatic relief even though they knew they were getting bogus remedies. Now, upon perusing the New Yorker, you might be mesmerized by Michael Specter's intriguing story on the history of placebos and burgeoning, research-minded attention to this highly-debatable subject at the intersection of health care, science, and medical ethics."},
