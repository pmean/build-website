	abstract = {Abstract: "{CONTEXT}: Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta(42)) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease ({AD}). Tarenflurbil, a selective Abeta(42)-lowering agent, demonstrated encouraging results on cognitive and functional outcomes among mildly affected patients in an earlier phase 2 trial. {OBJECTIVE}: To determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tarenflurbil. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PATIENTS}: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling patients with mild {AD} was conducted at 133 trial sites in the United States between February 21, 2005, and April 30, 2008. Concomitant treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine was permitted. {INTERVENTION}: Tarenflurbil, 800 mg, or placebo, administered twice a day. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Co-primary efficacy end points were the change from baseline to month 18 in total score on the subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale ({ADAS}-Cog, 80-point version) and Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Studies-activities of daily living ({ADCS}-{ADL}) scale. Additional prespecified slope analyses explored the possibility of disease modification. {RESULTS}: Of the 1684 participants randomized, 1649 were included in the analysis, and 1046 completed the trial. Tarenflurbil had no beneficial effect on the co-primary outcomes (difference in change from baseline to month 18 vs placebo, based on least squares means: 0.1 for {ADAS}-Cog; 95% {CI}, -0.9 to 1.1; P = .86 and -0.5 for {ADCS}-{ADL}; 95% {CI}, -1.9 to 0.9; P = .48) using an intent-to-treat analysis. No significant differences occurred in the secondary outcomes. The {ADAS}-Cog score decreased by 7.1 points over 18 months. The tarenflurbil group had a small increase in frequency of dizziness, anemia, and infections. {CONCLUSION}: Tarenflurbil did not slow cognitive decline or the loss of activities of daily living in patients with mild {AD}. {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: {NCT}00105547."},
