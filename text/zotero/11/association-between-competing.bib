This effect could not be explained by methodological quality or other factors. Interestingly, publications reporting other types of competing interests did not differ in reporting results. Abstract "Objective: To assess the association between competing interests and authors' conclusions in randomised clinical trials. Design: Epidemiological study of randomised clinical trials published in the {BMJ} from January 1997 to June 2001. Financial competing interests were defined as funding by for profit organisations and other competing interests as personal, academic, or political. Studies: 159 trials from 12 medical specialties. Main outcome measures: Authors' conclusions defined as interpretation of extent to which overall results favoured experimental intervention. Conclusions appraised on 6 point scale; higher scores favour experimental intervention. Results: Authors' conclusions were significantly more positive towards the experimental intervention in trials funded by for profit organisations alone compared with trials without competing interests (mean difference 0.48 ({SE} 0.13), P=0.014), trials funded by both for profit and non-profit organisations (0.30 ({SE} 0.10), P=0.003), and trials with other competing interests (0.45 ({SE} 0.13), P=0.006). Other competing interests and funding from both for profit and non-profit organisations were not significantly associated with authors' conclusions. The association between financial competing interests and authors' conclusions was not explained by methodological quality, statistical power, type of experimental intervention (pharmacological or non-pharmacological), type of control intervention (for example, placebo or active drug), or medical specialty. Conclusions: Authors' conclusions in randomised clinical trials significantly favoured experimental interventions if financial competing interests were declared. Other competing interests were not significantly associated with authors' conclusions."},
