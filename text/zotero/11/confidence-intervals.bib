	abstract = {The estimation approach to statistical analysis aims to quantify the effect of interest as an "estimate" of a clinically relevant quantity and to quantify the uncertainty in this estimate by means of a confidence interval ({CI}). As such, results expressed in this form are much more informative than results presented just as p values. This article focuses on the principles rather than the mathematics of {CIs} and discusses interpretation of {CIs} and some common misuses. {CIs} can be constructed for almost all analyses. They are especially useful for avoiding misinterpretation of nonsignificant results of small studies. {CIs} should be provided routinely for the main results of trials and observational studies.},
