	abstract = {Excerpt: "Subgroup analyses in randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}) or in meta-analyses of {RCTs} examine whether treatment effects vary according to patient group, way of giving an intervention, or approach to measuring an outcome. Subgroup analyses are common and often associated with claims of difference of treatment effects between subgroups—termed “subgroup effect", “effect modification”, or “interaction between a subgroup variable and treatment”. A difference in effect between subgroups, if true, is likely to have important implications for clinical practice and policy making. Many subgroup claims are, however, subsequently shown to be false. Thus, investigators, clinicians, and policy makers face the challenge of whether or not to believe apparent differences in effect. "},
