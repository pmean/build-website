	abstract = {Abstract: "In many phase {II} clinical trials, it is essential to assess both efficacy and safety. Although several phase {II} designs that accommodate multiple outcomes have been proposed recently, none are derived using decision theory. This paper describes a Bayesian decision theoretic strategy for constructing phase {II} designs based on both efficacy and adverse events. The gain function includes utilities assigned to patient outcomes, a reward for declaring the new treatment promising, and costs associated with the conduct of the phase {II} trial and future phase {III} testing. A method for eliciting gain function parameters from medical collaborators and for evaluating the design's frequentist operating characteristics is described. The strategy is illustrated by application to a clinical trial of peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma."},
