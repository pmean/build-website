Can we simply apply the overall trial result for each patient, or can the result be tailored to individual patients in some way? Consider a hypothetical example: a randomised trial comparing treatments A and B shows that treatment A is more effective than B among men (P < 0.001), but not among women (not signficant). Does this mean men should receive the new treatment, but women should not?"},
