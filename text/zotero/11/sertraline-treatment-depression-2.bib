	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Depression and antidepressant use are common in Alzheimer disease ({AD}), but the effect of antidepressant treatment for depression on longer term outcomes is unknown. The authors report the Week-24 outcomes of patients who participated in a 12-week efficacy study of sertraline for depression of {AD}. {METHODS}: One hundred thirty-one participants (sertraline = 67, placebo = 64) with mild-moderate {AD} and depression participated in the study. Patients who showed improvement on the modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression-Change ({mADCS}-{CGIC}) after 12 weeks of randomized treatment with sertraline or placebo continued double-blinded treatment for an additional 12 weeks. Depression response and remission at 24 weeks were based on {mADCS}-{CGIC} score and change in Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia ({CSDD}) score. Secondary outcome measures included time to remission, nonmood neuropsychiatric symptoms, global cognition, function, and quality of life. {RESULTS}: One hundred seventeen (89.3\%) participants completed all study assessments and 74 (56.5\%; sertraline = 38, placebo = 36) completed all 24 weeks on randomized treatment. By 24 weeks, there were no between-group differences in depression response (sertraline = 44.8\%, placebo = 35.9\%; odds ratio [95\% {CI}] = 1.23 [0.64-2.35]), change in {CSDD} score (median difference = 0.6 [95\% {CI}: -2.26 to 3.46], chi2 [df = 2] = 1.03), remission rates (sertraline = 32.8\%, placebo = 21.8\%; odds ratio [95\% {CI}] = 1.61 [0.70-3.68]), or secondary outcomes. Common selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-associated adverse events, specifically diarrhea, dizziness, and dry mouth, and pulmonary serious adverse events were more frequent in sertraline-randomized patients than in placebo subjects. {CONCLUSIONS}: Sertraline treatment is not associated with delayed improvement between 12 and 24 weeks of treatment and may not be indicated for the treatment of depression of {AD}."},
