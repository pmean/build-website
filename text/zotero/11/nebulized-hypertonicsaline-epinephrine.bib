	abstract = {Abstract: "Objective: To apply cumulative sum ({CUSUM}) to monitor a drug trial of nebulised hypertonic-saline in bronchiolitis. To test if monitoring with {CUSUM} control lines is practical and useful as a prompt to stop the drug trial early, if the study drug performs significantly worse than the comparator drug. Design: Prospective, open label, controlled trial using standard therapy (epinephrine) and study drug (hypertonic-saline) sequentially in two groups of patients. Setting: Hospital offering tertiary-level pediatric care. Patients: Children, 2 months to 2 years, with first episode of bronchiolitis, excluding those with cardiac disease, immunodeficiency and critical illness at presentation. Interventions: Nebulised epinephrine in first half of the bronchiolitis season (n = 35) and hypertonic saline subsequently (n = 29). Continuous monitoring of response to hypertonic-saline using {CUSUM} control-chart developed with epinephrine-response data. Main outcome measures: Clinical score, tachycardia and total duration of hospital stay. Results: In the epinephrine group, the maximum {CUSUM} was +2.25 ({SD} 1.34) and minimum {CUSUM} was -2.26 ({SD} 1.34). {CUSUM} score with hypertonic-saline group stayed above the zero line throughout the study. There was no statistical difference in the post-treatment clinical score at 24 hours between the treatment groups \{Mean ({SD}) 3.516 (2.816): 3.552 (2.686); 95% {CI}: -1.416 to + 1.356\}, heart rate \{Mean ({SD}) 136 (44): 137(12); 95% {CI}: -17.849 to +15.849) or duration of hospital stay (Mean ({SD}) 96.029 (111.41): 82.914 (65.940); 95% {CI}: -33.888 to +60.128\}. Conclusions: The software we developed allows for drawing of control lines to monitor study drug performance. Hypertonic-saline performed as well or better than nebulised epinephrine in bronchiolitis. Key words: Bronchiolitis, Control limit lines, {CUSUM}, Randomized Control Trials, Stopping rule.
