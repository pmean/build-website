	abstract = {Objective: To examine whether the increase in use of electronic cigarettes in the {USA}, which became noticeable around 2010 and increased dramatically by 2014, was associated with a change in overall smoking cessation rate at the population level.Design: Population surveys with nationally representative samples.Setting: Five of the {US} Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplement ({CPS}-{TUS}) in 2001-02, 2003, 2006-07, 2010-11, and 2014-15.Participants: Data on e-cigarette use were obtained from the total sample of the 2014-15 {CPS}-{TUS} (n=161,054). Smoking cessation rates were obtained from those who reported smoking cigarettes 12 months before the survey (n=23,270). Rates from 2014-15 {CPS}-{TUS} were then compared with those from 2010-11 {CPS}-{TUS} (n=27,280) and those from three other previous surveys.Main outcome measures: Rate of attempt to quit cigarette smoking and the rate of successfully quitting smoking, defined as having quit smoking for at least three months.Results: Of 161,054 respondents to the 2014-15 survey, 22,548 were current smokers and 2136 recent quitters. Among them, 38.2% of current smokers and 49.3% of recent quitters had tried e-cigarettes, and 11.5% and 19.0% used them currently (every day or some days). E-cigarette users were more likely than non-users to attempt to quit smoking, 65.1% v 40.1% (change=25.0%, 95% confidence interval 23.2% to 26.9%), and more likely to succeed in quitting, 8.2% v 4.8% (3.5%, 2.5% to 4.5%). The overall population cessation rate for 2014-15 was significantly higher than that for 2010-11, 5.6% v 4.5% (1.1%, 0.6% to 1.5%), and higher than those for all other survey years (range 4.3-4.5%).Conclusion: The substantial increase in e-cigarette use among {US} adult smokers was associated with a statistically significant increase in the smoking cessation rate at the population level. These findings need to be weighed carefully in regulatory policy making regarding e-cigarettes and in planning tobacco control interventions.},
