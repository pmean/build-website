	abstract = {Abstract: "Evidence Based Medicine ({EBM}) began as a 'bottom-up' paradigm that taught residents to search the literature for the best available evidence and to critically appraise it for making patient care decisions. As its popularity increased, there evolved a huge market for readymade {EBM} summaries and reviews and there is a now a scramble to provide this service. Those who provide the service come to wield tremendous influence and power. This article describes the evolution of this important tool and describes the pitfalls in how it is practiced. People in the health care field need to understand all these aspects of {EBM} if they are to exploit its potential for public health."},
