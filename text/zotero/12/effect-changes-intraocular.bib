	abstract = {Primary open-angle glaucoma ({POAG}) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States and worldwide. While lowering intraocular pressure ({IOP}) has been proven to be effective in delaying or preventing the onset of {POAG} in many large-scale prospective studies, one of the recent hot topics in glaucoma research is the effect of {IOP} fluctuation ({IOP} lability) on the risk of developing {POAG} in treated and untreated subjects.},
