	abstract = {Nested case-control studies become increasingly popular as they can be very efficient for quantifying the diagnostic accuracy of costly or invasive tests or (bio)markers. However, they do not allow for direct estimation of the test's predictive values or post-test probabilities, let alone for their confidence intervals ({CIs}). Correct estimates of the predictive values itself can easily be obtained using a simple correction by the (inverse) sampling fractions of the cases and controls. But using this correction to estimate the corresponding standard error ({SE}), falsely increases the number of patients that are actually studied, yielding too small {CIs}. We compared different approaches for estimating the {SE} and thus {CI} of predictive values or post-test probabilities of diagnostic test results in a nested case-control study.},
