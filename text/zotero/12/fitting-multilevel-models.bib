	abstract = {Multilevel models ({MLM}) offer complex survey data analysts a unique approach to understanding individual and contextual determinants of public health. However, little summarized guidance exists with regard to fitting {MLM} in complex survey data with design weights. Simulation work suggests that analysts should scale design weights using two methods and fit the {MLM} using unweighted and scaled-weighted data. This article examines the performance of scaled-weighted and unweighted analyses across a variety of {MLM} and software programs.},
