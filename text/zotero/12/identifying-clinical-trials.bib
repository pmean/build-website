	abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare the performance of {MEDLINE} and {EMBASE} for the identification of articles regarding controlled clinical trials ({CCTs}) published in English and related to selected topics: rheumatoid arthritis ({RA}), osteoporosis ({OP}), and low back pain ({LBP}). {MEDLINE} and {EMBASE} were searched for literature published in 1988 and 1994. The initial selection of papers was then reviewed to confirm that the articles were about {CCTs} and to assess the quality of the studies. Selected journals were also hand searched to identify {CCTs} not retrieved by either database. Overall, 4111 different references were retrieved (2253 for {RA}, 978 for {OP}, and 880 for {LBP}); 3418 (83%) of the papers were in English. {EMBASE} retrieved 78% more references than {MEDLINE} (2895 versus 1625). Overall, 1217 (30%) of the papers were retrieved by both databases. Two hundred forty-three papers were about {CCTs}. Two-thirds of these were retrieved by both databases, and one-third by only one. An additional 16 {CCTs} not retrieved by either database were identified through hand searching. Taking these into account, {EMBASE} retrieved 16% more {CCTs} than {MEDLINE} (220 versus 188); the {EMBASE} search identified 85% of the {CCTs} compared to 73% by {MEDLINE}. No significant differences were observed in the mean quality scores and sample size of the {CCTs} missed by {MEDLINE} compared to those missed by {EMBASE}. Our findings suggest that the use of {MEDLINE} alone to identify {CCTs} is inadequate. The use of two or more databases and hand searching of selected journals are needed to perform a comprehensive search.},
