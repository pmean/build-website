	abstract = {The National Cancer Institute ({NCI}) is actively transforming clinical trials to revitalize the clinical trials system and improve patient accrual. For more than 30 years, {NCI} has provided information and communication resources about cancer clinical trials. The Institute supports a clinical trials Web site (www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials) that receives nearly a half million page views a month. In addition, {NCI}'s Cancer Information Service (800-4-{CANCER}, chat and e-mail) responds to 1,750 clinical trial inquiries every month. Although these numbers suggest that a high volume of clinical trial information is being exchanged between {NCI}, the public, and providers, most patients decide whether to participate in clinical trials during the patient-provider interaction.},
