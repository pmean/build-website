For example, selective publication of clinical trials, and the outcomes within those trials, can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent riskâ€“benefit ratio.3,4 Attempts to study selective publication are complicated by the unavailability of data from unpublished trials. Researchers have found evidence for selective publication by comparing the results of published trials with information from surveys of authors,5 registries,6 institutional review boards,7,8 and . . .},
