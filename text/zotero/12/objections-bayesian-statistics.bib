	abstract = {Bayesian inference is one of the more controversial approaches to statistics. The
            fundamental objections to Bayesian methods are twofold: on one hand, Bayesian methods
            are presented as an automatic inference engine, and this raises suspicion in anyone with
            applied experience. The second objection to Bayes comes from the opposite direction and
            addresses the subjective strand of Bayesian inference. This article presents a series of
            objections to Bayesian inference, written in the voice of a hypothetical anti-Bayesian
            statistician. The article is intended to elicit elaborations and extensions of these and
            other arguments from non-Bayesians and responses from Bayesians who might have different
            perspectives on these issues.},
