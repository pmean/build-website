	abstract = {Electronic linkage to routine administrative datasets, such as the Hospital Episode Statistics ({HES}) in England, is increasingly used in medical research. Relatively little is known about the reliability of {HES} diagnostic information for epidemiological studies. In the United Kingdom ({UK}), general practitioners hold comprehensive records for individuals relating to their primary, secondary and tertiary care. For a random sample of participants in a large {UK} cohort, we compared vascular disease diagnoses in {HES} and general practice records to assess agreement between the two sources.},
