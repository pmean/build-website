	abstract = {Generalized Additive Model ({GAM}) provides a flexible and effective technique for modelling nonlinear time-series in studies of the health effects of environmental factors. However, {GAM} assumes that errors are mutually independent, while time series can be correlated in adjacent time points. Here, a {GAM} with Autoregressive terms ({GAMAR}) is introduced to fill this gap.},
