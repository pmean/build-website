	abstract = {Missing outcome data are very common in smoking cessation trials. It is often assumed that all such missing data are from participants who have  been unsuccessful in giving up smoking (``missing=smoking''). Here we use data from a recent Internet based smoking cessation trial in order to investigate  which of a set of a priori chosen baseline variables are predictive of missingness, and the evidence for and against the ``missing=smoking'' assumption.},
