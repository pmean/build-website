	abstract = {Randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) remain an indispensable form of human experimentation as a vehicle for discovery of new treatments. However, since their inception {RCTs} have raised ethical concerns. The ethical tension has revolved around “duties to individuals” vs. “societal value” of {RCTs}. By asking current patients “to sacrifice for the benefit of future patients” we risk subjugating our duties to patients’ best interest to the utilitarian goal for the good of others. This tension creates a key dilemma: when is it rational, from the perspective of the trial patients and researchers (as societal representatives of future patients), to enroll in {RCTs}?},
