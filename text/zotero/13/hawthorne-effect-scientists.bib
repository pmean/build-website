	abstract = {Description: Researchers frequently cite the "Hawthorne Effect" as a reason to run concurrent controls in any study. These studies were conducted in a factory called the Hawthorne Works, and demonstrated that any intervention would increase productivity. The conclusion was that it was the process of studying workers that caused the increase, and not any particular intervention. This article debunks the historical accuracy of the description of these experiments and questions whether there really is a Hawthorne Effect.},
