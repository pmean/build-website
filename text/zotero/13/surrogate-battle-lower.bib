	abstract = {I put this up to make people smile but to also get across the point that if you think that lowering blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose with medications always reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes etc then you really need to look at the evidence. 

Patients with very "big" blood pressures and glucose clearly get some benefit from medications but those with "slightly" elevated numbers likely get little if any important benefit.

I hope I was successful on both accounts.

I (James {McCormack}) and a good friend and colleague Mike Allan discuss all those issues, and much much more on the Therapeutics Education Collaboration Podcast at therapeuticseducation.org - the \#1 medical podcast in Canada and in the top 15 in most other countries - and you can find a synopsis of the study results mentioned in this video at mystudies.org. Would love feedback. {THANKS}.

The "14 studies" mentioned in the clip are: 

1) {LIPIDS}
{AIM}-{HIGH}, {HPS}2-{THRIVE} (niacin)
{ACCORD} (fibrates)
{dalOUTCOMES} (dalcetrapib)

2) {BLOOD} {PRESSURE}
{ALTITUDE} (aliskiren)
{VALISH},  {AASK},  {ACCORD} (aggressive {BP} lowering)

3) {DIABETES}
{ACCORD},  {ADVANCE},  {VADT} (aggressive A1c lowering)
{ROADMAP} (olmesartan)

4) {GENERAL}
{ACTIVE} (irbesartan/afib)
{CRESCENDO} (rimonabant)},
