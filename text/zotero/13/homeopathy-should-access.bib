Does homeopathy evidence really matter was followed up by  Amy Price [1] with a  rapid response  in the {BMJ} She states I am neutral on this form of intervention but I believe  important decisions need to be based on evidence rather than opinion.  The {NHS} ({UK} National Health Services) accepted homeopathy as an intervention with poor evidence and provide only opinion rather than evidence about homeopathy to remove it from use. Do we as citizens want our care to be based on  opinions or do we want medical evidence?"},
