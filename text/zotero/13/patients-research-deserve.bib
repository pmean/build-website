	abstract = {Excerpt: "Good decisions in patient research require listening with a mind to hear. Problem solve without blaming, Give research a chance! Let this video about research application  get you thinking about the problem with strictly following  guidelines and shooting for targets and {NOT} using evidence to help you and your patient make decisions. The lab coat logos are from top drug companies, top Rx medications and top guideline producers. Guidelines are useful but without evidence and common sense mixed with the values of the patients they are not enough. Patient, doctor or researcher when you make choices  make sure you know what the evidence is, what is the quality of this evidence and what the choices are. Good decisions for patient research require listening with a mind to hear."},
