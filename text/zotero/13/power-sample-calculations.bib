	abstract = {Methods of sample size and power calculations are reviewed for the most common study designs. The sample size and power equations for these designs are shown to be special cases of two generic formulae for sample size and power calculations. A computer program is available that can be used for studies with dichotomous, continuous, or survival response measures. The alternative hypotheses of interest may be specified either in terms of differing response rates, means, or survival times, or in terms of relative risks or odds ratios. Studies with dichotomous or continuous outcomes may involve either a matched or independent study design. The program can determine the sample size needed to detect a specified alternative hypothesis with the required power, the power with which a specific alternative hypothesis can be detected with a given sample size, or the specific alternative hypotheses that can be detected with a given power and sample size. The program can generate help messages on request that facilitate the use of this software. It writes a log file of all calculated estimates and can produce an output file for plotting power curves. It is written in {FORTRAN}-77 and is in the public domain.},
