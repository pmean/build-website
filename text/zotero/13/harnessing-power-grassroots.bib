	abstract = {Community-based participatory research ({CBPR}) is a collaborative approach to research that involves the equitable participation of those affected by an issue. As the field of global public health grows, the potential of {CBPR} to build capacity and to engage communities in identification of problems and development and implementation of solutions in sub-Saharan Africa has yet to be fully tapped. The Orphaned and Separated Children's Assessments Related to their Health and Well-Being ({OSCAR}) project is a longitudinal cohort of orphaned and non-orphaned children in Kenya. This paper will describe how {CBPR} approaches and principles can be incorporated and adapted into the study design and methods of a longitudinal epidemiological study in sub-Saharan Africa using this project as an example.},
