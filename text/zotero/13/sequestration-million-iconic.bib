	abstract = {{WASHINGTON} -- With little evidence that Congress will be able to find a budget fix, officials at one of America's most iconic medical research centers are warning that cuts brought about by sequestration could dramatically set back decades-long work. The Framingham Heart Study in Framingham, Mass. -- the longest running cardiovascular research project in the country -- saw a major funding stream slashed by \$4 million this year after lawmakers couldn't agree on a sequester replacement. Some of the effects have already been felt.}
