	abstract = {The original valuation exercise which formed the basis of the {UK} {EQ}-5D time trade-off social tariff of health states, employed a sampling scheme involving 43 health states. Neither that study, nor other published international valuations studies have used explicit quantifiable criteria to justify the choice of sampled states. New criteria are proposed and methods described to aid researchers in designing improved sampling schemes for future {EQ}-5D sampling exercises.},
