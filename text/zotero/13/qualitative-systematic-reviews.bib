	abstract = {Treatment burden can be defined as the self-care practices that patients with chronic illness must perform to respond to the requirements of their healthcare providers, as well as the impact that these practices have on patient functioning and well being.  Increasing levels of treatment burden may lead to suboptimal adherence and negative outcomes.  Systematic review of the qualitative literature is a useful method for exploring the patient experience of care, in this case the experience of treatment burden.  There is no consensus on methods for qualitative systematic review.  This paper describes the methodology used for qualitative systematic reviews of the treatment burdens identified in three different common chronic conditions, using stroke as our exemplar.},
