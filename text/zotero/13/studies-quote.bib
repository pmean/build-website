	abstract = {Some Studies That I like to Quote - a song designed to get you thinking about the problem with strictly following cardiovascular guidelines/target shooting and {NOT} using evidence to help you and your patient make decisions. The lab coat logos are from top drug companies, top Rx medications and top guideline producers. Guidelines are useful but make sure you know the evidence or lack thereof.

Yes I know this is the "1,432nd parody" of a song called "Somebody That I Used To Know" by Gotye.

Guidelines made me feel so happy I could die
I told my patients it was good enough
To lower glucose make them unconscious 
I put my 95 year-olds on a statin

I should have known all along that this was wrong 
100 over 60 made them fall, they really fall 
Stopping salt and fat did not make sense
I really should have looked at evidence
I didn't know that half of guidelines were just opinion

You say I need an {RCT}
One that actually shows a difference in a real outcome  
I'm supposed to know the {NNT}, and discuss it with my patients
Are you kidding me?

Don't know what a p-value is
You say I need a Cochrane review to help me find some numbers
I hear some surrogates were wrong
And now I need some studies I'm supposed to quote

Now I need some studies I'm supposed to quote
Now I need some studies I'm supposed to quote
       
Now and then I think of all the things you had me measure
You had me thinking there was always something that was wrong
All that fibre was an adventure
Now I'm passing wicker furniture
Beta-blockers made me feel real slow
And now you telling me about some studies that you need to quote 

But now I'm reading {RCTs}
You get a 1% reduction from a low dose statin      
I know now that an A1C of less than 8 is good enough as long as you don't pee
Forget about your {CRP}
Just don't eat like a great fat pig and go get some activity
I think that I can help you now
I finally have some studies that I like to quote

Some studies 
(That I like to quote)
Some studies
(Now I have some studies that I like to quote)

Some studies 
(That I like to quote)
Some studies
(Now I have some studies that I like to quote)

(That I like to quote)
(That I like to quote)
(That I like to quote)
(Some studies)
