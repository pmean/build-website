	abstract = {This paper describes the development of the {CAOS} test, designed to measure students' conceptual understanding of important statistical ideas, across three years of revision and testing, content validation, and reliability analysis. Results are reported from a large scale class testing and item responses are compared from pretest to posttest in order to learn more about areas in which students demonstrated improved performance from beginning to end of the course, as well as areas that showed no improvement or decreased performance. Items that showed an increase in students' misconceptions about particular statistical concepts were also examined. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for students' understanding of different statistical topics, followed by suggestions for further research. (Contains 9 tables.)},
