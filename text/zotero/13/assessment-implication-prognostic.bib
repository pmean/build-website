	abstract = {{BackgroundChance} imbalance in baseline prognosis of a randomized controlled trial can lead to over or underestimation of treatment effects, particularly in trials with small sample sizes. Our study aimed to (1) evaluate the probability of imbalance in a binary prognostic factor ({PF}) between two treatment arms, (2) investigate the impact of prognostic imbalance on the estimation of a treatment effect, and (3) examine the effect of sample size (n) in relation to the first two objectives.{MethodsWe} simulated data from parallel-group trials evaluating a binary outcome by varying the risk of the outcome, effect of the treatment, power and prevalence of the {PF}, and n. Logistic regression models with and without adjustment for the {PF} were compared in terms of bias, standard error, coverage of confidence interval and statistical power.{ResultsFor} a {PF} with a prevalence of 0.5, the probability of a difference in the frequency of the {PF}=5% reaches 0.42 with 125/arm. Ignoring a strong {PF} (relative risk<U+200A>=<U+200A>5) leads to underestimating the strength of a moderate treatment effect, and the underestimate is independent of n when n is >50/arm. Adjusting for such {PF} increases statistical power. If the {PF} is weak ({RR}<U+200A>=<U+200A>2), adjustment makes little difference in statistical inference. Conditional on a 5% imbalance of a powerful {PF}, adjustment reduces the likelihood of large bias. If an absolute measure of imbalance =5% is deemed important, including 1000 patients/arm provides sufficient protection against such an imbalance. Two thousand patients/arm may provide an adequate control against large random deviations in treatment effect estimation in the presence of a powerful {PF}.{ConclusionsThe} probability of prognostic imbalance in small trials can be substantial. Covariate adjustment improves estimation accuracy and statistical power, and hence should be performed when strong {PFs} are observed.},
