	abstract = {This paper describes factors influencing sample sizes needed for comparing survival data from two treatment groups. General formulas for sample size calculations are given for comparisons based on the logrank statistic and for comparisons based on the difference in two estimated survival curves at a fixed time point. The importance of various factors is illustrated by numerical examples. Factors that dilute the treatment effect, factors that alter the degree of censoring, and the choice of the test statistic have the greatest impact on required sample size. Adjustments for covariates, adjustments for repeated monitoring of accruing survival data, and adjustments for other types of multiple comparison, however, can also influence required sample size.},
