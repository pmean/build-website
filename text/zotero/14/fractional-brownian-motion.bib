	abstract = {Prediction of recruitment in clinical trials has been a challenging task. Many methods have been studied, including models based on Poisson process and its large sample approximation by Brownian motion ({BM}); however, when the independent incremental structure is violated for {BM} model, we could use fractional Brownian motion to model and approximate the underlying Poisson processes with random rates. In this paper, fractional Brownian motion ({FBM}) is considered for such conditions and compared to {BM} model with illustrated examples from different trials and simulations.},
