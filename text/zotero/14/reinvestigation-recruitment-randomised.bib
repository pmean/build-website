	abstract = {Randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}) are the gold standard assessment for health technologies. A key aspect of the design of any clinical trial is the target sample size. However, many publicly-funded trials fail to reach their target sample size. This study seeks to assess the current state of recruitment success and grant extensions in trials funded by the Health Technology Assessment ({HTA}) program and the {UK} Medical Research Council ({MRC}).
