	abstract = {This article is devoted to developing further a statistical technique for modeling patient recruitment together with randomization process in multicentre clinical trials. The analytic technique for predicting the number of patients recruited in different centers/regions for ongoing trials accounting for possible delays and closure of some centers is developed. The asymptotic properties of the recruitment in particular regions are investigated and the analysis of recruitment performance in centers/regions is provided. The approximations and predictive confidence bounds for the number of randomized patients in some region using center-stratified randomization are derived. These results are used for creating software tools for predictive patient recruitment and drug supply modeling in {GlaxoSmithKline}.},
