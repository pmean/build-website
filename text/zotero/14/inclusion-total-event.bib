	abstract = {Meta-analysis handles randomized trials with no outcome events in both treatment and control arms inconsistently, including them when risk difference ({RD}) is the effect measure but excluding them when relative risk ({RR}) or odds ratio ({OR}) are used. This study examined the influence of such trials on pooled treatment effects.
