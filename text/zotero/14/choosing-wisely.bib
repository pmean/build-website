{CHOOSING} {WISELY} - for spanish lyrics go to http://goo.gl/{MsDYVw}

It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
Less is more can often be the best way
There are tests, treatments and procedures you don't really need
While some are very useful, some at best mislead

[Chorus:]
Now we're choosing wisely
Body scans annual exams can do more harm than good
We're choosing wisely
Imaging for minor things may not give you the truth
We're choosing wisely
Antibiotics for a cold will do nothing but make you ill
We're choosing wisely
A routine screen for many things is often overkill

[Verse 2:]
You tell me you're worried you've got this and that, yeah,
Well, I truly care so don't hold it back, yeah,
But, from what I can see you'll be just fine, yeah,
You don't need that test, let's not waste our time 
Here's why

[Chorus]

[Bridge:] 
We want to (wisely) keep you - free from harm
That test result (wisely) can - cause alarm
That treatment (wisely) can make you - feel run-down
That drug  (wisely) could spin your head - round and round
I said (I want to keep you) (Wisely, wisely, wisely) - free from harm 
(Wisely, wisely, wisely) 
For that procedure you'll have to wear a - hospital gown
Doing nothing (wisely) can be your - lucky charm
I said

[Chorus 2x]

Hey, come on 

(wisely)
Free from harm ... do the right thing ... (wisely) 
Free from harm ... that dose is too high ... (wisely)
Free from harm ... use common sense ... (wisely) 
Free from harm, I said (let me tell you now)

 [Chorus 2x]
