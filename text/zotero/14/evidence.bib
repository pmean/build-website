{LYRICS}:
I used to view the world
As a place where I gave the word
It had the feeling of eminence
But then along came evidence

I used to give advice
See disarray in my patient's eyes
I listened to the companies sing
"Now the old drug is dead! We got a new thing!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my practice stands
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear the evidence bells a ringing
Systematic reviews are singing
Clinical evidence is the maxim
{NNTs} are now my passion

For some reason I can't explain 
Clinical studies are in my brain
Always an honest word
Now it's how I view the world

The beauty of forest plots 
Who knew they were more than dots 
Confidence intervals show the light   
I can figure out wrong from right

Relative numbers they can wait
I want absolute numbers on my plate
Values and preference 
Really make all the difference
 
I hear the evidence bells a ringing
Systematic reviews are singing
Clinical evidence is the maxim
{NNTs} are now my passion

For some reason I can't explain 
Clinical studies are in my brain
Always an honest word
Now it's how I view the world

I hear the evidence bells a ringing
Systematic reviews are singing
Clinical evidence is the maxim
{NNTs} are now my passion

For some reason I can't explain 
Clinical studies are in my brain
Always an honest word
Now it's how I view the world
