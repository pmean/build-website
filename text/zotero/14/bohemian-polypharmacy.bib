Is this my real life?
Is this my destiny?
I've been caught in a landslide,
Must escape polypharmacy.

I've opened my eyes,
Looked up to the skies now I see,
If I'm not a sick boy, I need no remedy,
But I trusted you, you should know
You started high, never low,
Many guidelines are opinions so they may not apply to me, to me.

Medications, can kill a man,
Like a gun against his head,
Used too many, now he's dead.
Medications, can also help,
So no don't go and throw them all away.

Medications, ooh,
I'll give them a try,
But if I've not improved at all by this time tomorrow,
I won't carry on, carry on unless I'm feeling better.

Too late, this drug I'm on,
Made mincemeat of my mind,
Body's aching all the time.
Come on some drugs have got to go,
Gotta leave these all behind and find what works.

Medications, ooh (is this helping who knows),
I don't wanna try,
Unless you tell me the benefits and harms for all.

Drugs can make a little silhouetto of a man,
Where's the proof, where's the proof, do you have at least one study?
Randomised and blinded,
Really enlightening me.
(Cochrane library) Cochrane library.
(Cochrane library) Cochrane library,
Cochrane library. Did you know?
Magnifico.

I'm not a slow boy, inform me well I may agree 
He's not a slow boy please listen to his plea,
Spare him his life from polypharmacy.

Easy come, easy go, will you start it low?
Specialist! No, we will not start it low.
(Start it low!) Specialist! We will not start it low.
(Start it low!) Specialist! We will not start it low.
(Start it low) Will not start it low.
(Start it low) Will not start it low.
Ah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Medications, medications, medications, start them low.
We've got to find the right dose that will work for me, for me, for me.

So you think you can test me and not tell me why?
So you think you can drug me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.

(Oh, yeah, oh yeah)

Stopping medications,
Anyone can see,
Stopping medications,
Can really make a difference to me.

Is this helping, who knows?
