	abstract = {Accurate prediction of recruitment in a clinical trial may help investigator to better allocate resources and to quickly make decision to intervene in the case of slow recruitment. In this paper, the theory of Brownian motion was used to model recruitment in a long-term clinical trial. The proposed model is illustrated using the recruitment experience of the Cholesterol and Recurrent Event ({CARE}) Trial.},
