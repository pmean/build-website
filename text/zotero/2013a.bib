	abstract = {The aim of this study was to use Monte Carlo simulations to compare logistic regression with propensity scores in terms of bias, precision, empirical coverage probability, empirical power, and robustness when the number of events is low relative to the number of confounders. The authors simulated a cohort study and performed 252,480 trials. In the logistic regression, the bias decreased as the number of events per confounder increased. In the propensity score, the bias decreased as the strength of the association of the exposure with the outcome increased. Propensity scores produced estimates that were less biased, more robust, and more precise than the logistic regression estimates when there were seven or fewer events per confounder. The logistic regression empirical coverage probability increased as the number of events per confounder increased. The propensity score empirical coverage probability decreased after eight or more events per confounder. Overall, the propensity score exhibited more empirical power than logistic regression. Propensity scores are a good alternative to control for imbalances when there are seven or fewer events per confounder; however, empirical power could range from 35\% to 60\%. Logistic regression is the technique of choice when there are at least eight events per confounder.},

While sample size estimation for comparison of binomial proportions has been adapted to typical clinical trial conditions such as noncompliance, lag time, and staggered entry, the estimation of sample size when the log-rank statistic is to be used has not been generalized to these types of clinical trial conditions. This paper presents a method of estimating sample sizes for the comparison of survival curves by the log-rank statistic in the presence of unrestricted rates of noncompliance, lag time, and so forth. The method applies to stratified trials in which the above conditions may vary across the different strata, and does not assume proportional hazards. Power and duration, as well as sample sizes, can be estimated. The method also produces estimates for binomial proportions and the Tarone-Ware class of statistics.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Disinvestment is critical for ensuring the long-term sustainability of health-care services. Key barriers to disinvestment are heterogeneity between research and clinical settings, absence of evidence of effectiveness of some health technologies, and exposure of patients and organizations to risks and poor outcomes. We aimed to develop a feasible research design that can evaluate disinvestment in health technologies of uncertain effectiveness or cost-effectiveness.
{STUDY} {DESIGN} {AND} {SETTING}: This article (1) establishes the need for disinvestment methodologies, (2) identifies the ethical concerns and feasibility constraints of conventional research designs for this issue, (3) describes the planning, implementation, and analytical framework for a novel disinvestment-specific study design, and (4) describes potential limitations in application of this design.
{RESULTS}: The stepped-wedge, roll-in cluster randomized controlled trial can facilitate the disinvestment process, whereas generating evidence to determine whether the decision to disinvest was sound in the clinical environment. A noninferiority research paradigm may be applied to this methodology to demonstrate that the removal of a health technology does not adversely affect outcomes.
{CONCLUSION}: This research design can be applied across multiple fields and will assist determination of whether specific health technologies are clinically effective, cost-effective, and safe.},

Results are reported from a large scale class testing and item responses are compared from pretest to posttest in order to learn more about areas in which students demonstrated improved performance from beginning to end of the course, as well as areas that showed no improvement or decreased performance. Items that showed an increase in students' misconceptions about particular statistical concepts were also examined. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for students' understanding of different statistical topics, followed by suggestions for further research. (Contains 9 tables.){\textbar}},

	abstract = {Context Physicians depend on the medical literature to keep current with clinical information. Little is known about residents' ability to understand statistical methods or how to appropriately interpret research outcomes.Objective To evaluate residents' understanding of biostatistics and interpretation of research results.Design, Setting, and Participants Multiprogram cross-sectional survey of internal medicine residents.Main Outcome Measure Percentage of questions correct on a biostatistics/study design multiple-choice knowledge test.Results The survey was completed by 277 of 367 residents (75.5\%) in 11 residency programs. The overall mean percentage correct on statistical knowledge and interpretation of results was 41.4\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 39.7\%-43.3\%) vs 71.5\% (95\% {CI}, 57.5\%-85.5\%) for fellows and general medicine faculty with research training (P {\textless} .001). Higher scores in residents were associated with additional advanced degrees (50.0\% [95\% {CI}, 44.5\%-55.5\%] vs 40.1\% [95\% {CI}, 38.3\%-42.0\%]; P {\textless} .001); prior biostatistics training (45.2\% [95\% {CI}, 42.7\%-47.8\%] vs 37.9\% [95\% {CI}, 35.4\%-40.3\%]; P = .001); enrollment in a university-based training program (43.0\% [95\% {CI}, 41.0\%-45.1\%] vs 36.3\% [95\% {CI}, 32.6\%-40.0\%]; P = .002); and male sex (44.0\% [95\% {CI}, 41.4\%-46.7\%] vs 38.8\% [95\% {CI}, 36.4\%-41.1\%]; P = .004). On individual knowledge questions, 81.6\% correctly interpreted a relative risk. Residents were less likely to know how to interpret an adjusted odds ratio from a multivariate regression analysis (37.4\%) or the results of a Kaplan-Meier analysis (10.5\%). Seventy-five percent indicated they did not understand all of the statistics they encountered in journal articles, but 95\% felt it was important to understand these concepts to be an intelligent reader of the literature.Conclusions Most residents in this study lacked the knowledge in biostatistics needed to interpret many of the results in published clinical research. Residency programs should include more effective biostatistics training in their curricula to successfully prepare residents for this important lifelong learning skill.},

It is furthermore inconceivable that a drug company will submit a New Drug Application claiming superior efficacy for placebo. Thus, the only probability of concern is the probability that apparent superiority of drug over placebo is a chance finding, and that is the probability associated with a one-tailed test.

	abstract = {Critics of systematic reviews have argued that these studies often fail to inform clinical decision making because their results are far too general, that the data are sparse, such that findings cannot be applied to individual patients or for other decision making. While there is some consensus on methods for investigating statistical and methodological heterogeneity, little attention has been paid to clinical aspects of heterogeneity. Clinical heterogeneity, true effect heterogeneity, can be defined as variability among studies in the participants, the types or timing of outcome measurements, and the intervention characteristics. The objective of this project was to develop recommendations for investigating clinical heterogeneity in systematic reviews.},

	abstract = {Open-label, randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) are subject to observer bias. If patient management is conducted without blinding, a difference between groups may be explained by other factors than study treatment. One factor may come from taking concomitant treatments with an efficacy on the studied outcomes. In type 2 diabetes, some antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs are effective against diabetic complications. We wanted to determine if these concomitant treatments were correctly reported in articles of {RCTs} on type 2 diabetes and if they might have influenced the outcome.},
