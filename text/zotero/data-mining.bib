	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: {MAGE}-{ML} has been promoted as a standard format for describing microarray experiments and the data they produce. Two characteristics of the {MAGE}-{ML} format compromise its use as a universal standard: First, {MAGE}-{ML} files are exceptionally large - too large to be easily read by most people, and often too large to be read by most software programs. Second, the {MAGE}-{ML} standard permits many ways of representing the same information. As a result, different producers of {MAGE}-{ML} create different documents describing the same experiment and its data. Recognizing all the variants is an unwieldy software engineering task, resulting in software packages that can read and process {MAGE}-{ML} from some, but not all producers. This Tower of {MAGE}-{ML} Babel bars the unencumbered exchange of microarray experiment descriptions couched in {MAGE}-{ML}. {RESULTS}: We have developed {XBabelPhish} - an {XQuery}-based technology for translating one {MAGE}-{ML} variant into another. {XBabelPhish}'s use is not restricted to translating {MAGE}-{ML} documents. It can transform {XML} files independent of their {DTD}, {XML} schema, or semantic content. Moreover, it is designed to work on very large ({\textgreater} 200 Mb.) files, which are common in the world of {MAGE}-{ML}. {CONCLUSION}: {XBabelPhish} provides a way to inter-translate {MAGE}-{ML} variants for improved interchange of microarray experiment information. More generally, it can be used to transform most {XML} files, including very large ones that exceed the capacity of most {XML} tools."},

Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by {DNA} microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia ({AML}) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ({ALL}) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Affymetrix microarrays have become increasingly popular in gene-expression studies; however, limitations of the technology have not been well established for commercially available arrays. The hybridization signal has been shown to be proportional to actual transcript concentration for specialized arrays containing hundreds of distinct probe pairs per gene. Additionally, the technology has been described as capable of distinguishing concentration levels within a factor of 2, and of detecting transcript frequencies as low as 1 in 2,000,000. Using commercially available arrays, we assessed these representations directly through a series of 'spike-in' hybridizations involving four prokaryotic transcripts in the absence and presence of fixed eukaryotic background. The contribution of probe-target interactions to the mismatch signal was quantified under various analyte concentrations. {RESULTS}: A linear relationship between transcript abundance and signal was consistently observed between 1 {pM} and 10 {pM} transcripts. The signal ceased to be linear above the 10 {pM} level and commenced saturating around the 100 {pM} level. The 0.1 {pM} transcripts were virtually undetectable in the presence of eukaryotic background. Our measurements show that preponderance of the signal for mismatch probes derives from interactions with the target transcripts. {CONCLUSIONS}: Landmark studies outlining an observed linear relationship between signal and transcript concentration were carried out under highly specialized conditions and may not extend to commercially available arrays under routine operating conditions. Additionally, alternative metrics that are not based on the difference in the signal of members of a probe pair may further improve the quantitative utility of the Affymetrix {GeneChip} array."},

For (1), there are many genes that characterize {DNA} expression, and it is of critical importance to try and identify a small set of genes that best discriminate between normal and tumor tissues. For (2), it is critical to be able to characterize the {DNA} expression of the normal and tumor tissue samples and develop suitable models that explain patterns of {DNA} expression for these types of tissues. Toward this goal, we propose a novel Bayesian model for analyzing {DNA} microarray data and propose a model selection methodology for identifying subsets of genes that show different expression levels between normal and cancer tissues. In addition, we propose a novel class of hierarchical priors for the parameters that allow us to borrow strength across genes for making inference. The properties of the priors are examined in detail. We introduce a Bayesian model selection criterion for assessing the various models, and develop Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for sampling from the posterior distributions of the parameters and for computing the criterion. We present a detailed case study in endometrial cancer to demonstrate our proposed methodology."},

Genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epidemiological data and microbial data provide different angles to our understanding of gene-environment interactions and the determinants of disease and health. Our goal and our challenge are to integrate these very different types of data and perspectives of disease into a global model suitable for dissecting the mechanisms of disease and for predicting novel therapeutic strategies. This review aims to highlight the need for and problems with complex data integration, and proposes a framework for data integration. While there are many obstacles to overcome, biological models based upon multiple datasets will probably become the basis that drives future biomedical research.}

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Tiling array data is hard to interpret due to noise. The wavelet transformation is a widely used technique in signal processing for elucidating the true signal from noisy data. Consequently, we attempted to denoise representative tiling array datasets for {ChIP}-chip experiments using wavelets. In doing this, we used specific wavelet basis functions, Coiflets, since their triangular shape closely resembles the expected profiles of true {ChIP}-chip peaks. {RESULTS}: In our wavelet-transformed data, we observed that noise tends to be confined to small scales while the useful signal-of-interest spans multiple large scales. We were also able to show that wavelet coefficients due to non-specific cross-hybridization follow a log-normal distribution, and we used this fact in developing a thresholding procedure. In particular, wavelets allow one to set an unambiguous, absolute threshold, which has been hard to define in {ChIP}-chip experiments. One can set this threshold by requiring a similar confidence level at different length-scales of the transformed signal. We applied our algorithm to a number of representative {ChIP}-chip data sets, including those of Pol {II} and histone modifications, which have a diverse distribution of length-scales of biochemical activity, including some broad peaks. {CONCLUSIONS}: Finally, we benchmarked our method in comparison to other approaches for scoring {ChIP}-chip data using spike-ins on the {ENCODE} Nimblegen tiling array. This comparison demonstrated excellent performance, with wavelets getting the best overall score."},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Most analyses of microarray data are based on point estimates of expression levels and ignore the uncertainty of such estimates. By determining uncertainties from Affymetrix {GeneChip} data and propagating these uncertainties to downstream analyses it has been shown that we can improve results of differential expression detection, principal component analysis and clustering. Previously, implementations of these uncertainty propagation methods have only been available as separate packages, written in different languages. Previous implementations have also suffered from being very costly to compute, and in the case of differential expression detection, have been limited in the experimental designs to which they can be applied.{RESULTS}:puma is a Bioconductor package incorporating a suite of analysis methods for use on Affymetrix {GeneChip} data. puma extends the differential expression detection methods of previous work from the 2-class case to the multi-factorial case. puma can be used to automatically create design and contrast matrices for typical experimental designs, which can be used both within the package itself but also in other Bioconductor packages. The implementation of differential expression detection methods has been parallelised leading to significant decreases in processing time on a range of computer architectures. puma incorporates the first R implementation of an uncertainty propagation version of principal component analysis, and an implementation of a clustering method based on uncertainty propagation. All of these techniques are brought together in a single, easy-to-use package with clear, task-based documentation.{CONCLUSION}:For the first time, the puma package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation methods available to a general audience. These methods can be used to improve results from more traditional analyses of microarray data. puma also offers improvements in terms of scope and speed of execution over previously available methods. puma is recommended for anyone working with the Affymetrix {GeneChip} platform for gene expression analysis and can also be applied more generally.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-10-10},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Some diseases, like tumors, can be related to chromosomal aberrations, leading to changes of {DNA} copy number. The copy number of an aberrant genome can be represented as a piecewise constant function, since it can exhibit regions of deletions or gains. Instead, in a healthy cell the copy number is two because we inherit one copy of each chromosome from each our parents.

Bayesian Piecewise Constant Regression ({BPCR}) is a Bayesian regression method for data that are noisy observations of a piecewise constant function. The method estimates the unknown segment number, the endpoints of the segments and the value of the segment levels of the underlying piecewise constant function. The Bayesian Regression Curve ({BRC}) estimates the same data with a smoothing curve. However, in the original formulation, some estimators failed to properly determine the corresponding parameters. For example, the boundary estimator did not take into account the dependency among the boundaries and succeeded in estimating more than one breakpoint at the same position, losing segments.{RESULTS}:We derived an improved version of the {BPCR} (called {mBPCR}) and {BRC}, changing the segment number estimator and the boundary estimator to enhance the fitting procedure. We also proposed an alternative estimator of the variance of the segment levels, which is useful in case of data with high noise. Using artificial data, we compared the original and the modified version of {BPCR} and {BRC} with other regression methods, showing that our improved version of {BPCR} generally outperformed all the others. Similar results were also observed on real data.{CONCLUSIONS}:We propose an improved method for {DNA} copy number estimation, {mBPCR}, which performed very well compared to previously published algorithms. In particular, {mBPCR} was more powerful in the detection of the true position of the breakpoints and of small aberrations in very noisy data. Hence, from a biological point of view, our method can be very useful, for example, to find targets of genomic aberrations in clinical cancer samples.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Due to the large number of hypothesis tests performed during the process of routine analysis of microarray data, a multiple testing adjustment is certainly warranted. However, when the number of tests is very large and the proportion of differentially expressed genes is relatively low, the use of a multiple testing adjustment can result in very low power to detect those genes which are truly differentially expressed. Filtering allows for a reduction in the number of tests and a corresponding increase in power. Common filtering methods include filtering by variance, average signal or {MAS} detection call (for Affymetrix arrays). In this paper, we study the effects of filtering in combination with the Benjamini-Hochberg
method for false discovery rate control and q-value for false
discovery rate estimation.{RESULTS}:Three case studies are used to compare three different filtering methods in combination with the two false discovery rate methods and three different preprocessing methods. For the case studies considered, filtering by detection call and variance (on the original scale) consistently led to an increase in the number of differentially expressed genes identified. On the other hand, filtering by variance on the log2 scale had a detrimental effect when paired with {MAS}5 and {PLIER} preprocessing methods, even when the testing was done on the log2 scale. A simulation study was done to further examine the effect of filtering by variance. We find that filtering by variance leads to higher power, often with a decrease in false discovery rate, when paired with either false discovery rate method. This holds regardless of the proportion of genes which are differentially expressed or whether we assume dependence or independence among genes.{CONCLUSIONS}:The case studies show that both detection call and variance filtering are viable methods of filtering which can increase the number of differentially expressed genes identified. The simulation study demonstrates that when paired with a false discovery rate method, filtering by variance can increase power while still controlling the false discovery rate. Filtering out \$50{\textbackslash}\%\$ of probe sets seems reasonable as long as the majority of genes are not expected to be differentially expressed.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Nowadays, microarray gene expression analysis is a widely used technology that scientists handle but whose final interpretation usually requires the participation of a specialist. The need for this participation is due to the requirement of some background in statistics that most users lack or have a very vague notion of. Moreover, programming skills could also be essential to analyse these data. An interactive, easy to use application seems therefore necessary to help researchers to extract full information from data and analyse them in a simple, powerful and confident way.{RESULTS}:{PreP}+07 is a standalone Windows {XP} application that presents a friendly interface for spot filtration, inter- and intra-slide normalization, duplicate resolution, dye-swapping, error removal and statistical analyses. Additionally, it contains two unique implementation of the procedures--double scan and Supervised Lowess--, a complete set of graphical representations--{MA} plot, {RG} plot, {QQ} plot, {PP} plot, {PN} plot-- and can deal with many data formats, such as tabulated text, {GenePix} {GPR} and {ArrayPRO}. {PreP}+07 performance has been compared with the equivalent functions in Bioconductor using a tomato chip with 13056 spots. The number of differentially expressed genes considering p-values coming from the {PreP}+07 and Bioconductor Limma packages were statistically identical when the data set was only normalized; however, a slight variability was appreciated when the data was both normalized and scaled. {CONCLUSIONS}:{PreP}+07 implementation provides a high degree of freedom in selecting and organizing a small set of widely used data processing protocols, and can handle many data formats. Its reliability has been proven so that a laboratory researcher can afford a statistical pre-processing of his/her microarray results and obtain a list of differentially expressed genes using {PreP}+07 without any programming skills.
