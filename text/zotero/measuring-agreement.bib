	abstract = {Description: This paper considers a Bayesian extension to the Bland-Altman chart to incorporate repeatability assessment as well as agreement among three or more methods. Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Assessing agreement in method comparison studies depends on two fundamentally important components; validity (the between method agreement) and reproducibility (the within method agreement). The Bland-Altman limits of agreement technique is one of the favoured approaches in medical literature for assessing between method validity. However, few researchers have adopted this approach for the assessment of both validity and reproducibility. This may be partly due to a lack of a flexible, easily implemented and readily available statistical machinery to analyse repeated measurement method comparison data. {METHODS}: Adopting the Bland-Altman framework, but using Bayesian methods, we present this statistical machinery. Two multivariate hierarchical Bayesian models are advocated, one which assumes that the underlying values for subjects remain static (exchangeable replicates) and one which assumes that the underlying values can change between repeated measurements (non-exchangeable replicates). {RESULTS}: We illustrate the salient advantages of these models using two separate datasets that have been previously analysed and presented; (i) assuming static underlying values analysed using both multivariate hierarchical Bayesian models, and (ii) assuming each subject's underlying value is continually changing quantity and analysed using the non-exchangeable replicate multivariate hierarchical Bayesian model. {CONCLUSIONS}: These easily implemented models allow for full parameter uncertainty, simultaneous method comparison, handle unbalanced or missing data, and provide estimates and credible regions for all the parameters of interest.

	abstract = {Description: There are several measures of agreement (such as the phi coefficient, the point biserial correlation, and the tetrachoric correlation) that are used to show relationships when one or both variables are binary. This paper shows the interrelationships and the interpretation of these correlations and relates them to other measures not traditionally thought of as measures of correlation, such as the odds ratio. Abstract: "{OBJECTIVE}: Presentation of effect sizes that can be interpreted in terms of clinical or practical significance is currently urged whenever statistical significance (a 'p-value') is reported in research journals. However, which effect size and how to interpret it are not yet clearly delineated. The present focus is on effect sizes indicating strength of correlation, that is, effect sizes that describe the strength of monotonic association between two random variables X and Y in a population. {METHODS}: A logical structure of measures of association is traced, showing the interrelationships among the many measures of association. Advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed. {CONCLUSIONS}: Suggestions are made for the future use of measures of association in research to facilitate considerations of clinical significance, emphasizing distribution-free effect sizes such as the Spearman correlation coefficient and Kendall's coefficient of concordance for ordinal versus ordinal associations, weighted and intraclass kappa for binary versus binary associations and risk difference ({RD}) for binary versus ordinal association."},

	abstract = {Description: This article provides an illustrative example of how to use the coefficient of variation to measure agreement on a continuous trait among several raters. Abstract: "{AIM}: To examine the reproducibility of crown-heel length measurement; the precision and reproducibility of knee-heel length measurement; and the association between the two in healthy preterm infants. {METHODS}: Paired crown-heel and knee-heel lengths were measured on 172 occasions by three observers in 43 preterm infants between 205and 458 days of postconceptional age. {RESULTS}: Crown-heel length ({CHL}) measurement was highly reproducible, with a coefficient of variation ({CV}) of 0.41\%. Knee-heel length ({KHL}) measurement was relatively precise ({CV} 0.78\%), but less reproducible (intra-observer {CV} 1.77\%, intra-observer {CV} 2.11\%), especially in larger infants. The association between {KHL} and {CHL} was not consistent and varied with age. {KHL} was a poor predictor of {CHL}, with a 95\% predictive interval of Â± 27.5mm. {CONCLUSIONS}: {KHL} was less reproducible than {CHL}, especially in larger infants, and a poor predictor of {CHL}."},
