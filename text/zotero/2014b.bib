	abstract = {Sample size calculations are advocated by the {CONSORT} group to justify sample sizes in randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}). The aim of this study was primarily to evaluate the reporting of sample size calculations, to establish the accuracy of these calculations in dental {RCTs} and to explore potential predictors associated with adequate reporting. Electronic searching was undertaken in eight leading specific and general dental journals. Replication of sample size calculations was undertaken where possible. Assumed variances or odds for control and intervention groups were also compared against those observed. The relationship between parameters including journal type, number of authors, trial design, involvement of methodologist, single-/multi-center study and region and year of publication, and the accuracy of sample size reporting was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Of 413 {RCTs} identified, sufficient information to allow replication of sample size calculations was provided in only 121 studies (29.3\%). Recalculations demonstrated an overall median overestimation of sample size of 15.2\% after provisions for losses to follow-up. There was evidence that journal, methodologist involvement ({OR} = 1.97, {CI}: 1.10, 3.53), multi-center settings ({OR} = 1.86, {CI}: 1.01, 3.43) and time since publication ({OR} = 1.24, {CI}: 1.12, 1.38) were significant predictors of adequate description of sample size assumptions. Among journals {JCP} had the highest odds of adequately reporting sufficient data to permit sample size recalculation, followed by {AJODO} and {JDR}, with 61\% ({OR} = 0.39, {CI}: 0.19, 0.80) and 66\% ({OR} = 0.34, {CI}: 0.15, 0.75) lower odds, respectively. Both assumed variances and odds were found to underestimate the observed values. Presentation of sample size calculations in the dental literature is suboptimal; incorrect assumptions may have a bearing on the power of {RCTs}.},

In internal pilot study designs, nuisance parameters are estimated on the basis of interim data and the sample size is adjusted accordingly.

Every day, we are bombarded by attention grabbing headlines that promise miracle cures to all of our ailments -- often backed up by a "scientific study." But what are these studies, and how do we know if they are reliable? David H. Schwartz dissects two types of studies that scientists use, illuminating why you should always approach the claims with a critical eye.

	abstract = {The sandwich estimator, also known as robust covariance matrix estimator, heteroscedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimate, or empirical covariance matrix estimator, has achieved increasing use in the econometric literature as well as with the growing popularity of generalized estimating equations. Its virtue is that it provides consistent estimates of the covariance matrix for parameter estimates even when the fitted parametric model fails to hold or is not even specified. Surprisingly though, there has been little discussion of properties of the sandwich method other than consistency. We investigate the sandwich estimator in quasi-likelihood models asymptotically, and in the linear case analytically. We show that under certain circumstances when the quasi-likelihood model is correct, the sandwich estimate is often far more variable than the usual parametric variance estimate. The increased variance is a fixed feature of the method and the price that one pays to obtain consistency even when the parametric model fails or when there is heteroscedasticity. We show that the additional variability directly affects the coverage probability of confidence intervals constructed from sandwich variance estimates. In fact, the use of sandwich variance estimates combined with t-distribution quantiles gives confidence intervals with coverage probability falling below the nominal value. We propose an adjustment to compensate for this fact.},

	abstract = {Due to concern and debate in the epilepsy medical community and to the current interest of the {US} Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) in revising approaches to the approval of generic drugs, the {FDA} is currently supporting ongoing bioequivalence studies of antiepileptic drugs, the {EQUIGEN} studies. During the design of these crossover studies, the researchers could not find commercial or non-commercial statistical software that quickly allowed computation of sample sizes for their designs, particularly software implementing the {FDA} requirement of using random-effects linear models for the analyses of bioequivalence studies. This article presents tables for sample-size evaluations of average bioequivalence studies based on the two crossover designs used in the {EQUIGEN} studies: the four-period, two-sequence, two-formulation design, and the six-period, three-sequence, three-formulation design. Sample-size computations assume that random-effects linear models are used in bioequivalence analyses with crossover designs. Random-effects linear models have been traditionally viewed by many pharmacologists and clinical researchers as just mathematical devices to analyze repeated-measures data. In contrast, a modern view of these models attributes an important mathematical role in theoretical formulations in personalized medicine to them, because these models not only have parameters that represent average patients, but also have parameters that represent individual patients. Moreover, the notation and language of random-effects linear models have evolved over the years. Thus, another goal of this article is to provide a presentation of the statistical modeling of data from bioequivalence studies that highlights the modern view of these models, with special emphasis on power analyses and sample-size computations.},

Outliers are not explicitly modelled, but rejection of extreme observations occurs naturally in any Bayesian analysis of data from distributions with suitably thick tails. For other distributions outlier rejection behaviour can never occur. These phenomena motivate new definitions of outlier-proneness and outlier-resistance. The definitions and methodology are Bayesian but the conclusions also have meaning for non-Bayesians because they are proved for arbitrary prior distributions. Thus, for example, the t distribution is said to be outlier-prone because it is shown that any admissible inference procedure applied to a t sample will effectively ignore extreme outlying observations regardless of prior information. On the other hand, the normal distribution, for example, is said to be outlier-resistant because it never allows outlier rejection, regardless of prior information.},

	abstract = {Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterised by spinal inflammation, progressive spinal rigidity, and peripheral arthritis. Interleukin 17 ({IL}-17) is thought to be a key inflammatory cytokine in the development of ankylosing spondylitis, the prototypical form of spondyloarthritis. We assessed the efficacy and safety of the anti-{IL}-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab in treating patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.
We did a randomised double-blind proof-of-concept study at eight centres in Europe (four in Germany, two in the Netherlands, and two in the {UK}). Patients aged 18–65 years were randomly assigned (in a 4:1 ratio) to either intravenous secukinumab (2×10 mg/kg) or placebo, given 3 weeks apart. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated block randomisation list without a stratification process. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a 20\% response according to the Assessment of {SpondyloArthritis} international Society criteria for improvement ({ASAS}20) at week 6 (Bayesian analysis). Safety was assessed up to week 28. This study is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}00809159.
37 patients with moderate-to-severe ankylosing spondylitis were screened, and 30 were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous secukinumab (n=24) or placebo (n=6). The final efficacy analysis included 23 patients receiving secukinumab and six patients receiving placebo, and the safety analysis included all 30 patients. At week 6, {ASAS}20 response estimates were 59\% on secukinumab versus 24\% on placebo (99·8\% probability that secukinumab is superior to placebo). One serious adverse event (subcutaneous abscess caused by Staphylococcus aureus) occurred in the secukinumab-treated group.
Secukinumab rapidly reduced clinical or biological signs of active ankylosing spondylitis and was well tolerated. It is the first targeted therapy that we know of that is an alternative to tumour necrosis factor inhibition to reach its primary endpoint in a phase 2 trial.

	abstract = {We present a definition for the effective sample size of a parametric prior distribution in a Bayesian model, and propose methods for computing the effective sample size in a variety of settings. Our approach first constructs a prior chosen to be vague in a suitable sense, and updates this prior to obtain a sequence of posteriors corresponding to each of a range of sample sizes. We then compute a distance between each posterior and the parametric prior, defined in terms of the curvature of the logarithm of each distribution, and the posterior minimizing the distance defines the effective sample size of the prior. For cases where the distance cannot be computed analytically, we provide a numerical approximation based on Monte Carlo simulation. We provide general guidelines for application, illustrate the method in several standard cases where the answer seems obvious, and then apply it to some nonstandard settings.},

In the first report Iain Chalmers et al discuss how decisions about which research to fund should be based on issues relevant to users of research. Next, John Ioannidis et al consider improvements in the appropriateness of research design, methods, and analysis. Rustam Al-Shahi Salman et al then turn to issues of efficient research regulation and management. Next, An-Wen Chan et al examine the role of fully accessible research information. Finally, Paul Glasziou et al discuss the importance of unbiased and usable research reports. These papers set out some of the most pressing issues, recommend how to increase value and reduce waste in biomedical research, and propose metrics for stakeholders to monitor the implementation of these recommendations.

To date, both public and private research enterprise has predominantly funded efficacy research. Comparative effectiveness research holds promise to generate much-needed effectiveness data. However, given the large number of important clinical questions, it will not be possible to provide reliable empirical efficacy, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness data for every question to help guide individual decision-making.1 Instead, practitioners will continue to rely on inductive reasoning to apply the results of the study (“group averages” from an efficacy trial) to individual patients who often differ in important ways from patients enrolled in the efficacy trial (eg, these patients may be older, have comorbid conditions, or might be using multiple medications).},

This paper suggests use of sample size formulae for comparing means or for comparing proportions in order to calculate the required sample size for a simple logistic regression model. One can then adjust the required sample size for a multiple logistic regression model by a variance inflation factor. This method requires no assumption of low response probability in the logistic model as in a previous publication. One can similarly calculate the sample size for linear regression models. This paper also compares the accuracy of some existing sample-size software for logistic regression with computer power simulations. An example illustrates the methods. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We can either generate confidence limits around the observed treatment effect or retrospectively compare it with the effect hypothesized before the trial. If the observed effect is small, the risk of the false-negative conclusion (and the sample size required to draw negative or equivalency conclusions) is often much less than that generated by the "prospective" calculation.},
