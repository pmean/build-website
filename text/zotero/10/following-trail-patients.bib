As a “defaulter tracer,” Peter tries to track them down, find out what’s gone wrong and get them back into treatment, if possible. Epidemiologists refer to such patients as “lost to follow-up,” and their increasing numbers in sub-Saharan Africa are causing concern among providers of H.I.V. and {AIDS} care. Interruptions in treatment lead to viral strains that are resistant to the cheapest medications, and to higher rates of illness and death."}
