	annote = {There is a tendency among some, including myself, to preferentially rely on journal articles where you can get the full text on the Internet. This is acceptable in some cases, but you need to worry about a type of publication bias. Papers with full text might be more likely to show positive outcomes, though that is a bit speculative. If what you are studying is important, you need to conduct a thorough search of the literature and not just relying on what is easily available.},
	abstract = {Abstract: "{OBJECTIVE}: To determine whether availability of journals on {MEDLINE} as {FUTON} (full text on the Net) affects their impact factor. {MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS}: A comprehensive search identified 324 cardiology, nephrology, and rheumatology/immunology journals on-line until May 2003. The status of these journals was ascertained in {MEDLINE} as having {FUTON}, abstracts only, and {NAA} (no abstract available). Impact factors for all available journals from the Institute for Scientific Information ({ISI}) were abstracted. {RESULTS}: Of the 324 Journals, 124 (38.3%) were {FUTON}, 138 (42.6%) had abstracts only, and 62 (19.1%) had {NAA}. The mean (+/-{SEM}) impact factor was 3.24 (+/-0.32), 1.64 (+/-0.30), and 0.14 (+/-0.45), respectively. Of the 324 current journals, 159 existed in both the pre- and the post-Internet era. An analysis of the change (ie, delta) in impact factor from the pre- to post-Internet era revealed a trend between journals with {FUTON} and abstracts only (P=.17, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Similar analyses of the delta of cardiology journals revealed a statistically significant difference between Journals with {FUTON} and abstracts only (P=.04, Wilcoxon rank sum test). {CONCLUSION}: {FUTON} bias is the tendency to peruse what is more readily available. This is the first study to show that on-line availability of medical literature may increase the impact factor and that such increase tends to be greater in {FUTON} journals. Failure to consider this bias may affect a journal's impact factor. Also, it could limit consideration of medical literature by ignoring relevant {NAA} articles and thereby influence medical education akin to publication or language bias."}
