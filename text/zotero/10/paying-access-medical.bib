Quantifying how much money will be saved by increased efficiency due to open access seems like fuzzy math at best.  However, we do need better access to medical journal articles.  As a researcher, I’ve constantly fought the battle against firewalled journals.  I am fortunate to be part of a university that has excellent access to most of the published medical research I need.  But I still come across what is the researchers’ equivalent of the “blue screen of death”:  the “login or purchase this individual article for \$30<U+2033> screen."},
