	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: In longitudinal cohort studies, subjects may be lost to follow-up at any time during the study. This leads to attrition and thus to a risk of inaccurate and biased estimations. The purpose of this paper is to show how multiple imputation can take advantage of all the information collected during follow-up in order to estimate the cumulative probability P(E) of an event E, when the first occurrence of this event is observed at t successive time points of a longitudinal study with attrition. {METHODS}: We compared the performance of multiple imputation with that of Kaplan-Meier estimation in several simulated attrition scenarios. {RESULTS}:I n missing-completely-at-random scenarios, the multiple imputation and Kaplan-Meier methods performed well in terms of bias (less than 1\%) and coverage rate (range = [94.4\%; 95.8\%]). In missing-at-random scenarios, the Kaplan-Meier method was associated with a bias ranging from -5.1\% to 7.0\% and with a very poor coverage rate (as low as 0.2\%). Multiple imputation performed much better in this situation (bias {\textless}2\%, coverage rate {\textgreater}83.4\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: Multiple imputation shows promise for estimation of an occurrence rate in cohorts with attrition. This study is a first step towards defining appropriate use of multiple imputation in longitudinal studies."},
