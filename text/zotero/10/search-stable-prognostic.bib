	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: In prognostic studies model instability and missing data can be troubling factors. Proposed methods for handling these situations are bootstrapping (B) and Multiple imputation ({MI}). The authors examined the influence of these methods on model composition. {METHODS}: Models were constructed using a cohort of 587 patients consulting between January 2001 and January 2003 with a shoulder problem in general practice in the Netherlands (the Dutch Shoulder Study). Outcome measures were persistent shoulder disability and persistent shoulder pain. Potential predictors included socio-demographic variables, characteristics of the pain problem, physical activity and psychosocial factors. Model composition and performance (calibration and discrimination) were assessed for models using a complete case analysis, {MI}, bootstrapping or both {MI} and bootstrapping. {RESULTS}: Results showed that model composition varied between models as a result of how missing data was handled and that bootstrapping provided additional information on the stability of the selected prognostic model. {CONCLUSION}: In prognostic modeling missing data needs to be handled by {MI} and bootstrap model selection is advised in order to provide information on model stability."},
