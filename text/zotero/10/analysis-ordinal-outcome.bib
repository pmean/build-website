	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Malaria remains a burden in Sub-Saharan Countries. The strategy proposed by the World Health Organization ({WHO}) is to systematically compare the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drugs using as primary outcome for efficacy, a four-category ordered criterion. The objective of the present work was to analyze the treatment effects on this primary outcome taking into account both a center-effect and individual covariates. A three-arm, three-centre trial of Amodiaquine ({AQ}), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ({SP}) and their combination ({AQ} + {SP}), conducted by {OCEAC}-{IRD} in 2003, in 538 children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, is used as an illustration. {METHODS}: Analyses were based on ordinal regression methods, assuming an underlying continuous latent variable, using either the proportional odds ({PO}) or the proportional hazards ({PH}) models. Different algorithms, corresponding to both frequentist- and bayesian-approaches, were implemented using the freely available softwares R and Winbugs, respectively. The performances of the different methods were evaluated on a simulated data set, and then they were applied on the trial data set. {RESULTS}: Good coverage probability and type-1 error for the treatment effect were achieved. When the methods were applied on the trial data set, results highlighted a significance decrease of {SP} efficacy when compared to {AQ} ({PO}, odds ratio [{OR}] 0.14, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.04-0.57; hazard ratio [{HR}] 0.605, 95\% {CI} 0.42-0.82), and an equal effectiveness between {AQ} + {SP} and {AQ} ({PO}, odds ratio [{OR}] 1.70, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.25-11.44; hazard ratio [{HR}] 1.40, 95\% {CI} 0.88-2.18). The body temperature was significantly related to the responses. The patient weights were marginally associated to the clinical response. {CONCLUSION}: The proposed analyses, based on usual statistical packages, appeared adapted to take into account the full information contained in the four categorical outcome in malaria trials, as defined by {WHO}, with the possibility of adjusting on individual and global covariates."},
