	abstract = {{RATIONALE}, {AIMS} {AND} {OBJECTIVES}: Unbeknown to many, reductionist and postmodern worldviews competitively coexist in science and society. The debate on evidence-based medicine ({EBM}) is at the tip of this 'iceberg'. Via systems thinking and complexity science {EBM} reveals crucial flaws and its reductionism entails an inability to appreciate (even tolerate) contrasting ideas and/or 'see a bigger picture'. An interdisciplinary approach provides insight into novel explanations. Thereafter, the conceptual barrier shifts to communication, a challenge which mandates attempts to steer the discourse by reframing the debate. {METHOD}: Interdisciplinary perspectives serve to illustrate a 'bigger picture'. Also, 'wicked' questions stimulate reflection, discern leverage points and dismantle resilient defences. Lastly, a proposal: exploring the value of 'glasses half full'. {CONCLUSION}: Some may realize that postmodern concepts behind compelling criticisms to {EBM} have already taken root, being shared by policymakers, practitioners and patients as well.},
