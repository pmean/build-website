	abstract = {Posted on the {BioMEd} Central Blog, Thursdy, September 2, 2010. Excerpt: "Support for scientific data sharing is gathering more and more  support in 2010, so rather than “why share data?” the question now is “how?”. Making data available in readily interpretable formats is vital to realising its value in driving new knowledge discovery, and {BMC} Research Notes today launches a new initiative aimed at promoting best practice in sharing and publishing data, with a focus on standardized, re-useable formats."},
