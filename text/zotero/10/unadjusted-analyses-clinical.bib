	abstract = {Excerpt: "One of the delights of clinical practice has proven to be a major nuisance for clinical research: patients are nonidentical. Indeed, patients have multiple characteristics that influence the likelihood of the outcome of a disease, which can make it difficult in the extreme to accurately discern the effects of therapy from casual clinical experience or even careful observational studies. Randomization, a process by which patients are assigned to a treatment arm by chance rather than by choice, was a brilliant innovation that has made possible causal inferences regarding a treatment's effect. Although randomization is not perfect in practice, it is remarkably effective at ensuring the comparability between treatment groups, so much so that it has almost tricked us into thinking that patient differences in outcome risks have been rendered irrelevant in the context of clinical trials."},
