Ways to achieve evidence-based practice are reviewed here and the most common criticisms described. The latter can be classified as "limitations universal to the practice of medicine," "limitations unique to evidence-based medicine" and "misperceptions of evidence-based medicine." Potential solutions to the true limitations of evidence-based medicine are discussed and areas for future work highlighted."},
