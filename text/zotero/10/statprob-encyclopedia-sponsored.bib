	abstract = {Excerpt: "{StatProb}: The Encyclopedia Sponsored by Statistics and Probability Societies combines the advantages of traditional wikis (rapid and up-to-date publication, user-generated development, hyperlinking, and a saved history) with traditional publishing (quality assurance, review, credit to authors, and a structured information display). All contributions have been approved by an editorial board determined by leading statistical societies; the editorial board members are listed on the About page. All encyclopedia entries are written in {LaTeX}. All of the entries are automatically cross-referenced and the entire corpus is kept updated in real-time. Anyone can view articles. To submit a new article or propose a change in an existing article, you must create an account. It takes only a minute, so sign up!"},
