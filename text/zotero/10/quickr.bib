	abstract = {Excerpt: "R is an elegant and comprehensive statistical and graphical programming language. Unfortunately, it can also have a steep learning curve. I created this website for experienced users of popular statistical packages such as {SAS}, {SPSS}, Stata, and Systat (although current R users should also find it useful). My goal is to help you quickly access this language in your work."},
