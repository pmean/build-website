	abstract = {Excerpt: "“The Conflicted University” examines the endangered future of independent, transparent research for the common good at universities across the country. Guest editor Sheldon Krimsky, one of the nation's experts in scientific conflicts of interest, teamed up with Academe editor Cat Warren to create this expanded issue of Academe. In this special issue, a group of internationally respected academics, science journalists, and other experts tackle what have become some of the thorniest issues facing higher education: corporate conflicts of interest, the chilling of scientific speech and academic freedom, and the urgent need to protect the integrity of scientific research."},
