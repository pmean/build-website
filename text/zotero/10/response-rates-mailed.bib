	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: In recent years, response rates to telephone surveys have declined. Online surveys may miss many older and poorer adults. Mailed surveys may have promise in securing higher response rates. {METHODS}: In a pilot study, 1200 breast, prostate and colon patients, randomly selected from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry, were sent surveys in the mail. Incentive amount (\$3 vs. \$5) and length of the survey (10 pages vs. 16 pages) were randomly assigned. {RESULTS}: Overall, there was a high response rate ({AAPOR} {RR}4 = 64%). Neither the amount of the incentive, nor the length of the survey affected the response rate significantly. Colon cancer surveys were returned at a significantly lower rate ({RR}4 = 54%), than breast or prostate surveys ({RR}4 = 71%, and {RR}4 = 67%, respectively; p < .001 for both comparisons). There were no significant interactions among cancer type, length of survey and incentive amount in their effects on response likelihood. {CONCLUSION}: Mailed surveys may provide a suitable alternative option for survey-based research with cancer patients."},
