	abstract = {Healthcare, etc. blog posting on 2010-10-09. Exceprt: "As you may have noticed, I have been thinking a lot about the nature of our research enterprise and its output as it relates to practical decisions that need to be made in the real world by physicians and policy makers. I have come to the conclusion that it is woefully inadequate in so many ways, and in fact it may even be borderline unethical. My thinking on this has been influenced at least in part by some of my reading of the work by the Tufts group led by David M. Kent, who has written a lot about the impact of heterogeneous treatment response on the central measures we report in trials -- I urge you to look their work up on Medline. (My potential {COI} here is that I did all of my Internal Medicine and Pulmonary and Critical Care training at Tufts in the 1990s, but did not know or work with Kent or his group). But admittedly I have been thinking about a lot of this stuff on my own as well, as I have advocated risk stratification for quite some time now. So, here is what I have been thinking."},
