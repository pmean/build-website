	abstract = {Excerpt: "Once a relationship between two variables is established, it is common for researchers to consider the role of other variables in this relationship (Lazarsfeld, 1955). In one situation, moderation or effect modification, an observed relationship may be different at different levels of a third variable. In a second situation, which is the focus of this site, a third variable provides a clearer interpretation of the relationship between the two variables. A clearer interpretation may be obtained by elucidating the causal process among the three variables, a mediational hypothesis. "},
