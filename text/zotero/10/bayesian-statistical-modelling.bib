	abstract = {Description: A fairly technical book, but what book about Bayesian methods is not? The first chapter provides a detailed explanation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The remaining chapter provide some very sophisticated examples. Excerpt: "Bayesian methods combine the evidence from the data at hand with previous quantitative knowledge to analyse practical problems in a wide range of areas. The calculations were previously complex, but it is now possible to routinely apply Bayesian methods due to advances in computing technology and the use of new sampling methods for estimating parameters. Such developments together with the availability of freeware such as {WINBUGS} and R have facilitated a rapid growth in the use of Bayesian methods, allowing their application in many scientific disciplines, including applied statistics, public health research, medical science, the social sciences and economics. Following the success of the first edition, this reworked and updated book provides an accessible approach to Bayesian computing and analysis, with an emphasis on the principles of prior selection, identification and the interpretation of real data sets. The second edition: * Provides an integrated presentation of theory, examples, applications and computer algorithms. * Discusses the role of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in computing and estimation. * Includes a wide range of interdisciplinary applications, and a large selection of worked examples from the health and social sciences. * Features a comprehensive range of methodologies and modelling techniques, and examines model fitting in practice using Bayesian principles. * Provides exercises designed to help reinforce the reader's knowledge and a supplementary website containing data sets and relevant programs. Bayesian Statistical Modelling is ideal for researchers in applied statistics, medical science, public health and the social sciences, who will benefit greatly from the examples and applications featured. The book will also appeal to graduate students of applied statistics, data analysis and Bayesian methods, and will provide a great source of reference for both researchers and students."},
