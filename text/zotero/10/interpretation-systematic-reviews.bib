	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Discrepancies between the conclusions of different meta-analyses (quantitative syntheses of systematic reviews) are often ascribed to methodological differences. The objective of this study was to determine the discordance in interpretations when meta-analysts are presented with identical data. {METHODS}: We searched the literature for all randomized clinical trials ({RCT}) and review articles on the efficacy of intravenous magnesium in the early post-myocardial infarction period. We organized the articles chronologically and grouped them in packages. The first package included the first {RCT}, and a summary of the review articles published prior to first {RCT}. The second package contained the second and third {RCT}, a meta-analysis based on the data, and a summary of all review articles published prior to the third {RCT}. Similar packages were created for the 5th {RCT}, 10th {RCT}, 20th {RCT} and 23rd {RCT} (all articles). We presented the packages one at a time to eight different reviewers and asked them to answer three clinical questions after each package based solely on the information provided. The clinical questions included whether 1) they believed magnesium is now proven beneficial, 2) they believed magnesium will eventually be proven to be beneficial, and 3) they would recommend its use at this time. {RESULTS}: There was considerable disagreement among the reviewers for each package, and for each question. The discrepancies increased when the heterogeneity of the data increased. In addition, some reviewers became more sceptical of the effectiveness of magnesium over time, and some reviewers became less sceptical. {CONCLUSION}: The interpretation of the results of systematic reviews with meta-analyses includes a subjective component that can lead to discordant conclusions that are independent of the methodology used to obtain or analyse the data."},
