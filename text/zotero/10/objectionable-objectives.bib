Even from looking at the title, you just know this academic paper from the September edition of the International Journal of Evidence-based Healthcare is going to be an absolute corker. And it uses the word "fascist" (or elaborate derivatives) 28 times in six pages, which even Rik Mayall in The Young Ones might have described as "overdoing it"."},
