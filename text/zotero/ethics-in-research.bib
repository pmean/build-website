The letter writer is critical of the article and claims that research subjects in the study have been 'harmed, stigmatised and quite probably subjected to increased levels of violence'. He goes on to argue that the subjects did not provide informed consent. 'When women gave permission to be tested for {HIV} they did not anticipate that it would be used to stigmatise them, and presumably when they gave consent for it to be used for research they were not informed of that.'"},

	abstract = {Six healthy young male volunteers at a contract research organization were enrolled in the first phase 1 clinical trial of {TGN}1412, a novel superagonist anti-{CD}28 monoclonal antibody that directly stimulates T cells. Within 90 minutes after receiving a single intravenous dose of the drug, all six volunteers had a systemic inflammatory response characterized by a rapid induction of proinflammatory cytokines and accompanied by headache, myalgias, nausea, diarrhea, erythema, vasodilatation, and hypotension. Within 12 to 16 hours after infusion, they became critically ill, with pulmonary infiltrates and lung injury, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe and unexpected depletion of lymphocytes and monocytes occurred within 24 hours after infusion. All six patients were transferred to the care of the authors at an intensive care unit at a public hospital, where they received intensive cardiopulmonary support (including dialysis), high-dose methylprednisolone, and an anti-interleukin-2 receptor antagonist antibody. Prolonged cardiovascular shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in two patients, who required intensive organ support for 8 and 16 days. Despite evidence of the multiple cytokine-release syndrome, all six patients survived. Documentation of the clinical course occurring over the 30 days after infusion offers insight into the systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the absence of contaminating pathogens, endotoxin, or underlying disease.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of {HIV} in Vancouver, British Columbia was subject to two distinct periods of rapid increase. The first occurred in the 1980s due to high incidence among men who have sex with men ({MSM}), and the second occurred in the 1990s due to high incidence among injection drug users ({IDU}). The purpose of this study was to estimate and model the trends in {HIV} prevalence in Vancouver from 1980 to 2006. {HIV} prevalence data were entered into the {UNAIDS}/{WHO} Estimation and Projection Package ({EPP}) where prevalence trends were estimated by fitting an epidemiological model to the data. Epidemic curves were fit for {IDU}, {MSM}, female sex trade workers ({FSW}), and the general population. Using {EPP}, these curves were then aggregated to produce a model of Vancouver's overall {HIV} prevalence. Of the 505 000 people over the age of 15 that reside in Vancouver, 6108 (ranging from 4979 to 7237) were living with {HIV} in the year 2006, giving an overall prevalence of 1.21 percent (ranging from 0.99 to 1.43 percent). The subgroups of {IDU} and {MSM} account for the greatest proportion of {HIV} infections. Our model estimates that the prevalence of {HIV} in Vancouver is greater than one percent, roughly 6 times higher than Canada's national prevalence. These results suggest that {HIV} infection is having a relatively large impact in Vancouver and that evidence-based prevention and harm reduction strategies should be expanded.},
