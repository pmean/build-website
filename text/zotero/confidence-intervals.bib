	abstract = {Excerpt: "In the last decade, guidelines for the presentation of statistical results in medical journals have emphasized confidence intervals ({CIs}) as an adjunct to, or even a replacement for, statistical tests and p values. Because of the intimate links between the 2 concepts, authors now use statements like "the 95\% {CI} overlaps 0" where they would formerly have stated "the difference is not statistically significant at the 5\% level." Although this interchangeability is technically correct in 1-sample situations, it does not carry over fully to comparisons involving 2 samples. A frequently encountered misconception is that if 2 independent 95\% {CIs} overlap each other, as they do in Fig. 1, then a statistical test of the difference will not be statistically significant at the 5\% level."},
