	abstract = {Excerpt: "Resampling procedures, also commonly referred to as computer intensive statistical inference procedures, may be used to assess the significance of a statistic in a hypothesis test or to determine the lower and upper bounds for a confidence interval when the usual assumptions of parametric statistical procedures are not met (Manly, 1991). Computer intensive procedures require the recomputation of hundreds or thousands of artificially constructed data sets. Like other nonparametric statistical procedures, these procedures existed as theory on paper long before they were brought into the practical mainstream. The Monte Carlo method of resampling, for example, was introduced by Barnard in 1963 (Noreen, 1989), but at that time could only be illustrated and implemented operationally on very small sample sizes.

However, with the advent of fast, inexpensive computing, essentially since around 1990, the use of computer intensive procedures has grown dramatically, particularly in the area of basic academic research. Actually, with the widespread availability of powerful personal computers and statistical software that even brings resampling-type methods right into the home, the name computer intensive seems today to be as anachronistic as it was descriptive just a few years ago."},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Health-related quality of life is a topic of current interest. This paper considers a randomized phase {III} study of radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy (docetaxel) versus radiation therapy alone in non-small cell lung cancer, stage {III} A/B. Longitudinal data on quality of life have been obtained through repeated administration of a multi-item questionnaire ({EORTC} {QLQ}-C30) developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer. Missingness in the data is owing to patients having failed to complete the questionnaire at some of the scheduled filling-in times.{METHODS}:We have analysed a monotone (in terms of missingness) subset of the data as regards estimation of the mean score of a summary measure of self-reported quality of life in a hypothetical drop-out-free population at different points in time. Missingness is a difficult issue of great importance. We have therefore chosen to compare three different methods that are relatively easy to implement: the linear-increments method, the inverse-probability-weighting method and the Markov-process method. Single imputation has been applied in a supplementary analysis to fill in for all the non-consecutive missing score values prior to the execution of the estimation procedure.{RESULTS}:For the response in focus, the observed mean score at a certain time is larger than the estimated mean scores, which implies that the true mean score is easily overestimated unless the missingness is appropriately adjusted for. Comparison of the treatment arms shows a significant difference in mean score at the end of treatment.{CONCLUSIONS}:Use of proper methodology developed for analysing data subject to missingness is necessary to reduce potential estimation bias. The quality of life of patients receiving radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy (docetaxel) appears somewhat worse than that of patients receiving radiation therapy alone in the period during which treatment is given. The conclusions are robust for the choice of statistical methods.},

	abstract = {Health-Related Quality of Life ({HRQoL}) measures are becoming increasingly used in clinical trials as primary outcome measures. Investigators are now asking statisticians for advice on how to analyse studies that have used {HRQoL} outcomes.{HRQoL} outcomes, like the {SF}-36, are usually measured on an ordinal scale. However, most investigators assume that there exists an underlying continuous latent variable that measures {HRQoL}, and that the actual measured outcomes (the ordered categories), reflect contiguous intervals along this continuum.The ordinal scaling of {HRQoL} measures means they tend to generate data that have discrete, bounded and skewed distributions. Thus, standard methods of analysis such as the t-test and linear regression that assume Normality and constant variance may not be appropriate. For this reason, conventional statistical advice would suggest that non-parametric methods be used to analyse {HRQoL} data. The bootstrap is one such computer intensive non-parametric method for analysing data.We used the bootstrap for hypothesis testing and the estimation of standard errors and confidence intervals for parameters, in four datasets (which illustrate the different aspects of study design). We then compared and contrasted the bootstrap with standard methods of analysing {HRQoL} outcomes. The standard methods included t-tests, linear regression, summary measures and General Linear Models.Overall, in the datasets we studied, using the {SF}-36 outcome, bootstrap methods produce results similar to conventional statistical methods. This is likely because the t-test and linear regression are robust to the violations of assumptions that {HRQoL} data are likely to cause (i.e. non-Normality). While particular to our datasets, these findings are likely to generalise to other {HRQoL} outcomes, which have discrete, bounded and skewed distributions. Future research with other {HRQoL} outcome measures, interventions and populations, is required to confirm this conclusion.},

	abstract = {Objective To verify or refute the value of hospital episode statistics ({HES}) in determining 30 day mortality after open congenital cardiac surgery in infants nationally in comparison with central cardiac audit database ({CCAD}) information. Design External review of paediatric cardiac surgical outcomes in England ({HES}) and all {UK} units ({CCAD}), as derived from each database. Setting Congenital heart surgery centres in the United Kingdom. Data sources {HES} for congenital heart surgery and corresponding information from {CCAD} for the period 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2002. {HES} was restricted to the 11 English centres; {CCAD} covered all 13 {UK} centres. Main outcome measure Mortality within 30 days of open heart surgery in infants aged under 12 months. Results In a direct comparison for the years when data from the 11 English centres were available from both databases, {HES} omitted between 5\% and 38\% of infants operated on in each centre. A median 40\% (range 0-73\%) shortfall occurred in identification of deaths by {HES}. As a result, mean 30 day mortality was underestimated at 4\% by {HES} as compared with 8\% for {CCAD}. In {CCAD}, between 1\% and 23\% of outcomes were missing in nine of 11 English centres used in the comparison (predominantly those for overseas patients). Accordingly, {CCAD} mortality could also be underestimated. Oxford provided the most complete dataset to {HES}, including all deaths recorded by {CCAD}. From three years of {CCAD}, Oxford's infant mortality from open cardiac surgery (10\%) was not statistically different from the mean for all 13 {UK} centres (8\%), in marked contrast to the conclusions drawn from {HES} for two of those years. Conclusions Hospital episode statistics are unsatisfactory for the assessment of activity and outcomes in congenital heart surgery. The central cardiac audit database is more accurate and complete, but further work is needed to achieve fully comprehensive risk stratified mortality data. Given unresolved limitations in data quality, commercial organisations should reconsider placing centre specific or surgeon specific mortality data in the public domain.},
