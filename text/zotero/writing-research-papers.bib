	abstract = {Excerpt: "Aims: The purpose of the survey was to determine expert views on how to report the results of studies that produced non-significant results. The ultimate aim is to produce agreed guidelines for non-significant results. Method: Respondents were presented with 2 scenarios of studies comparing 2 groups on the proportion of people with high blood pressure. Results were given as proportion in each group with high blood pressure, size of the study and the (non-significant) chi-square. Respondents were first asked for free form text on how the results should be reported to lay and professional audiences. They were then presented with multiple choices for the proportions of respondents with high bop in each group that would be expected in a replication study. Discipline, role, experience and further comments were also elicited."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Stents are commonly used to treat patients with coronary artery disease. However, the quality of reporting internal and external validity data in published reports of randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}) of stents has never been assessed.
The objective of our study was to evaluate the quality of reporting internal and external validity data in published reports of {RCTs} assessing the stents for percutaneous coronary interventions. {METHODS}: A systematic literature review was conducted. Reports of {RCTs} assessing stents for percutaneous coronary interventions indexed in {MEDLINE} and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and published between January 2003 and September 2008 were selected. A standardized abstraction form was used to extract data. All analyses were adjusted for the effect of clustering articles by journal. {RESULTS}: 132 articles were analyzed. The generation of the allocation sequence was adequate in 58.3\% of the reports; treatment allocation was concealed in 34.8\%. Adequate blinding was reported in one-fifth of the reports. An intention-to-treat analysis was described in 79.5\%. The main outcome was a surrogate angiographic endpoint in 47.0\%. The volume of interventions per center was described in two reports. Operator expertise was described in five (3.8\%) reports. The quality of reporting was better in journals with high impact factors and in journals endorsing the {CONSORT} statement. {CONCLUSIONS}: The current reporting of results of {RCTs} testing stents needs to be improved to allow readers to appraise the risk of bias and the applicability of the results."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{OBJECTIVE}: Although crossover trials enjoy wide use, standards for analysis and reporting have not been established. We reviewed methodological aspects and quality of reporting in a representative sample of published crossover trials. {METHODS}: We searched {MEDLINE} for December 2000 and identified all randomized crossover trials. We abstracted data independently, in duplicate, on 14 design criteria, 13 analysis criteria, and 14 criteria assessing the data presentation. {RESULTS}: We identified 526 randomized controlled trials, of which 116 were crossover trials. Trials were drug efficacy (48\%), pharmacokinetic (28\%), and nonpharmacologic (30\%). The median sample size was 15 (interquartile range 8-38). Most (72\%) trials used 2 treatments and had 2 periods (64\%). Few trials reported allocation concealment (17\%) or sequence generation (7\%). Only 20\% of trials reported a sample size calculation and only 31\% of these considered pairing of data in the calculation. Carry-over issues were addressed in 29\% of trial's methods. Most trials reported and defended a washout period (70\%). Almost all trials (93\%) tested for treatment effects using paired data and also presented details on by-group results (95\%). Only 29\% presented {CIs} or {SE} so that data could be entered into a meta-analysis. {CONCLUSION}: Reports of crossover trials frequently omit important methodological issues in design, analysis, and presentation. Guidelines for the conduct and reporting of crossover trials might improve the conduct and reporting of studies using this important trial design."},

Thus, it is of fundamental importance that data reported in abstracts are consistent with those reported in the body of the article.

	shorttitle = {{CONSORT} for Reporting Randomized Controlled Trials in Journal and Conference Abstracts},
	abstract = {Abstract: "Background: Clear, transparent, and sufficiently detailed abstracts of conferences and journal articles related to randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) are important, because readers often base their assessment of a trial solely on information in the abstract. Here, we extend the {CONSORT} (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement to develop a minimum list of essential items, which authors should consider when reporting the results of a {RCT} in any journal or conference abstract. Methods and Findings: We generated a list of items from existing quality assessment tools and empirical evidence. A three-round, modified-Delphi process was used to select items. In all, 109 participants were invited to participate in an electronic survey; the response rate was 61\%. Survey results were presented at a meeting of the {CONSORT} Group in Montebello, Canada, January 2007, involving 26 participants, including clinical trialists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and biomedical editors. Checklist items were discussed for eligibility into the final checklist. The checklist was then revised to ensure that it reflected discussions held during and subsequent to the meeting. {CONSORT} for Abstracts recommends that abstracts relating to {RCTs} have a structured format. Items should include details of trial objectives; trial design (e.g., method of allocation, blinding/masking); trial participants (i.e., description, numbers randomized, and number analyzed); interventions intended for each randomized group and their impact on primary efficacy outcomes and harms; trial conclusions; trial registration name and number; and source of funding. We recommend the checklist be used in conjunction with this explanatory document, which includes examples of good reporting, rationale, and evidence, when available, for the inclusion of each item. Conclusions: {CONSORT} for Abstracts aims to improve reporting of abstracts of {RCTs} published in journal articles and conference proceedings. It will help authors of abstracts of these trials provide the detail and clarity needed by readers wishing to assess a trial's validity and the applicability of its results."},
