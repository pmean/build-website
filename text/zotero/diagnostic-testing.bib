Whereas these studies mostly investigate general and representative patient populations, clinical decisions most often depend on individual patient characteristics. To concede to the need of individually based guidelines, many {RCTs} report analyses on specific subgroups of patients.1,2 The main aim of a subgroup analysis is to identify either consistency of or large differences in the magnitude of treatment effect among different categories of patients. Determining whether the observed overall treatment effect is different across certain subgroups may justly provide some patients with its benefits and protect others from its harm."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "Because accurate diagnosis lies at the heart of medicine, it is important to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic tests. A variety of accuracy measures are used. One particularly widely used measure is the {AUC}, the area under the receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve. This measure has a well-understood weakness when comparing {ROC} curves which cross. However, it also has the more fundamental weakness of failing to balance different kinds of misdiagnoses effectively. This is not merely an aspect of the inevitable arbitrariness in choosing a performance measure, but is a core property of the way the {AUC} is defined. This property is explored, and an alternative, the H measure, is described. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: The receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve is a fundamental tool to assess the discriminant performance for not only a single marker but also a score function combining multiple markers. The area under the {ROC} curve ({AUC}) for a score function measures the intrinsic ability for the score function to discriminate between the controls and cases. Recently, the partial {AUC} ({pAUC}) has been paid more attention than the {AUC}, because a suitable range of the false positive rate can be focused according to various clinical situations. However, existing {pAUC}-based methods only handle a few markers and do not take nonlinear combination of markers into consideration. {RESULTS}: We have developed a new statistical method that focuses on the {pAUC} based on a boosting technique. The markers are combined componentially for maximizing the {pAUC} in the boosting algorithm using natural cubic splines or decision stumps (single-level decision trees), according to the values of markers (continuous or discrete). We show that the resulting score plots are useful for understanding how each marker is associated with the outcome variable. We compare the performance of the proposed boosting method with those of other existing methods, and demonstrate the utility using real data sets. As a result, we have much better discrimination performances in the sense of the {pAUC} in both simulation studies and real data analysis. {CONCLUSIONS}: The proposed method addresses how to combine the markers after a {pAUC}-based filtering procedure in high dimensional setting. Hence, it provides a consistent way of analyzing data based on the {pAUC} from maker selection to marker combination for discrimination problems. The method can capture not only linear but also nonlinear association between the outcome variable and the markers, about which the nonlinearity is known to be necessary in general for the maximization of the {pAUC}. The method also puts importance on the accuracy of classification performance as well as interpretability of the association, by offering simple and smooth resultant score plots for each marker."},

We identified adult patients, hospitalized in 2005 with at least two blood tests during admission, where requests for general blood profiles and specifically for neutrophil counts were contrasted in scenario analyses. Possible effect modifiers were diagnosis and glucocorticoid use. {RESULTS}: A total of 567 patients with requested neutrophil counts and 1,439 patients with non-requested neutrophil counts were analyzed. The absolute neutrophil count at admission differed with a mean of 7.4.10E9/l for requested counts and 8.3.10E9/l for non-requested counts (p-value {\textless}0.001). This difference could be explained for 83.2\% by the occurrence of cardiovascular disease as underlying disease and for 4.5\% by glucocorticoid use. {CONCLUSION}: Requests for neutrophil counts in clinical databases are associated with underlying disease and with cardiovascular disease in particular.

We describe the two prerequisites for cancer overdiagnosis to occur: the existence of a silent disease reservoir and activities leading to its detection (particularly cancer screening). We estimated the magnitude of overdiagnosis from randomized trials: about 25\% of mammographically detected breast cancers, 50\% of chest x-ray and/or sputum-detected lung cancers, and 60\% of prostate-specific antigen-detected prostate cancers. We also review data from observational studies and population-based cancer statistics suggesting overdiagnosis in computed tomography-detected lung cancer, neuroblastoma, thyroid cancer, melanoma, and kidney cancer. To address the problem, patients must be adequately informed of the nature and the magnitude of the trade-off involved with early cancer detection. Equally important, researchers need to work to develop better estimates of the magnitude of overdiagnosis and develop clinical strategies to help minimize it."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "The accuracy of a binary-scale diagnostic test can be represented by sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and positive and negative predictive values ({PPV} and {NPV}). Although Se and Sp measure the intrinsic accuracy of a diagnostic test that does not depend on the prevalence rate, they do not provide information on the diagnostic accuracy of a particular patient. To obtain this information we need to use {PPV} and {NPV}. Since {PPV} and {NPV} are functions of both the accuracy of the test and the prevalence of the disease, constructing their confidence intervals for a particular patient is not straightforward. In this paper, a novel method for the estimation of {PPV} and {NPV}, as well as their confidence intervals, is developed. For both predictive values, standard, adjusted and their logit transformed-based confidence intervals are compared using coverage probabilities and interval lengths in a simulation study. These methods are then applied to two case-control studies: a diagnostic test assessing the ability of the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene ({ApoE}.e4) on distinguishing patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) and a prognostic test assessing the predictive ability of a 70-gene signature on breast cancer metastasis.

The data were originally collected at peri-urban health clinics in Zimbabwe. {METHODS}: Conventional accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) estimates for {VIA} and two other screening tests using colposcopy/biopsy as the reference standard were compared to {LCA} estimates based on results from all four tests. For conventional analysis, negative colposcopy was accepted as a negative outcome when biopsy was not available as the reference standard. With {LCA}, local dependencies between tests were handled through adding direct effect parameters or additional latent classes to the model. {RESULTS}: Two models yielded good fit to the data, a 2-class model with two adjustments and a 3-class model with one adjustment. The definition of latent disease associated with the latter was more stringent, backed by three of the four tests. Under that model, sensitivity for {VIA} (abnormal+) was 0.74 compared to 0.78 with conventional analyses. Specificity was 0.639 versus 0.568, respectively. By contrast, the {LCA}-derived sensitivity for colposcopy/biopsy was 0.63. {CONCLUSION}: {VIA} sensitivity and specificity with the 3-class {LCA} model were within the range of published data and relatively consistent with conventional analyses, thus validating the original assessment of test accuracy. {LCA} probably yielded more likely estimates of the true accuracy than did conventional analysis with in-country colposcopy/biopsy as the reference standard.

To examine the process of care for diabetic patients with elevated triage blood pressure (≥140/90 mm Hg) during routine primary care visits to assess whether a treatment change occurred and to what degree specific patient and provider factors correlated with the likelihood of treatment change.
Prospective cohort study.
9 Veterans Affairs facilities in 3 midwestern states. 1169 diabetic patients with scheduled visits to 92 primary care providers from February 2005 to March 2006.
Proportion of patients who had a change in a blood pressure treatment (medication intensification or planned follow-up within 4 weeks). Predicted probability of treatment change was calculated from a multilevel logistic model that included variables assessing clinical uncertainty, competing demands and prioritization, and medication-related factors (controlling for blood pressure).
Overall, 573 (49\%) patients had a blood pressure treatment change at the visit. The following factors made treatment change less likely: repeated blood pressure by provider recorded as less than 140/90 mm Hg versus 140/90 mm Hg or greater or no recorded repeated blood pressure (13\% vs. 61\%;  {\textless} 0.001); home blood pressure reported by patients as less than 140/90 mm Hg versus 140/90 mm Hg or greater or no recorded home blood pressure (18\% vs. 52\%;  {\textless} 0.001); provider systolic blood pressure goal greater than 130 mm Hg versus 130 mm Hg or less (33\% vs. 52\%;  = 0.002); discussion of conditions unrelated to hypertension and diabetes versus no discussion (44\% vs. 55\%;  = 0.008); and discussion of medication issues versus no discussion (23\% vs. 52\%;  {\textless} 0.001). Providers knew that the study pertained to diabetes and hypertension, and treatment change was assessed for 1 visit per patient. Approximately 50\% of diabetic patients presenting with a substantially elevated triage blood pressure received treatment change at the visit. Clinical uncertainty about the true blood pressure value was a prominent reason that providers did not intensify therapy."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Cancer screening programmes in England are publicly-funded. Professionals' beliefs in the public health benefits of screening can conflict with individuals' entitlements to exercise informed judgement over whether or not to participate. The recognition of the importance of individual autonomy in decision making requires greater understanding of the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs upon which people's screening choices are founded. Until recently, the technology available required that cancer screening be confined to women. This study aimed to discover whether male and female perceptions of cancer and of screening differ. {METHODS}: Data on the public's cancer beliefs were collected by means of a postal survey (anonymous questionnaire). Two general practices based in Nottingham and in Mansfield, in east-central England, sent questionnaires to registered patients aged 30 to 70 years. 1,808 completed questionnaires were returned for analysis, 56.5 per cent from women. {RESULTS}: Women were less likely to underestimate overall cancer incidence, although each sex was more likely to cite a sex-specific cancer as being amongst the most common cancer site. In terms of risk factors, men were most uncertain about the role of stress and sexually-transmitted diseases, whereas women were more likely to rate excessive alcohol and family history as major risk factors. The majority of respondents believed the public health care system should provide cancer screening, but significantly more women than men reported having benefiting from the nationally-provided screening services. Those who were older, in better health or had longer periods of formal education were less worried about cancer than those who had illness experiences, lower incomes, or who were smokers. Actual or potential participation in bowel screening was higher amongst those who believed bowel cancer to be common and amongst men, despite women having more substantial worries about cancer than men. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our results suggest that men's and women's differential knowledge of cancer correlates with women's closer involvement with screening. Even so, men were neither less positive about screening nor less likely to express a willingness to participate in relevant screening in the future. It is important to understand gender-related differences in knowledge and perceptions of cancer, if health promotion resources are to be allocated efficiently."},

To assess the diagnostic accuracy that may be achieved by this approach, we related items of the history, symptoms and signs, and routine blood tests to the presence/absence of cirrhosis in a unique, previously established, consecutive series of 303 alcohol-abusing men, in whom liver biopsy was performed irrespective of the clinical and biochemical findings. Using logistic regression analyses, we created a clinical, a combined clinical and biochemical, and a pure biochemical diagnostic model. The probability of cirrhosis in patients with the specified characteristics was estimated, the diagnostic accuracy was assessed as functions of diagnostic thresholds for cirrhosis defined by the probability of cirrhosis varying between 0 and 1,and confidence intervals were estimated by bootstrap sampling. The clinical model, including facial teleangiectasia, vascular spiders, white nails, abdominal veins, fatness, and peripheral edema, could be used with high diagnostic accuracy and it was clearly superior to the biochemical model. Adding biochemical findings to the clinical model improved the accuracy of the clinical model only slightly.
