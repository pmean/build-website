The level of ethical concern will vary according to the nature of the information, and the way in which it is collected - analyses of anonymised hospital admission records may carry a quite different ethical burden than analyses of potentially identifiable health information collected directly from the study participants. It is striking that most discussions about data sharing focus almost exclusively on issues of ownership (by the researchers or the funders) and efficiency (on the part of the funders). There is usually little discussion of the ethical issues involved in data sharing, and its implications for the study participants. Obtaining prior informed consent from the participants does not solve this problem, unless the informed consent process makes it completely clear what is being proposed, in which case most study participants would not agree. Thus, the undoubted benefits of data sharing doe not remove the obligations and responsibilities that the original investigators hold for the people they invited to participate in the study."},

{ABSTRACT}:


{BACKGROUND}

A previous study has documented the reliability and validity of the Treatment Satisfaction with Medicines Questionnaire ({SATMED}-Q) in exploring patient satisfaction with medicines for chronic health conditions in routine medical practice, but the minimally important difference ({MID}) of this tool is as yet unknown. The objective of this research was to estimate the {MID} for the {SATMED}-Q total score and six constituent domains.


{METHODS}

The sample of patients (456 subjects, mean age 59 years, 53\% male) used for testing psychometric properties was also used to assess {MID}. Item \#14 of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication ({TSQM}) was used as an anchor reference since it directly explores satisfaction with medicine on a 7-point ordinal scale (from extremely satisfied to extremely dissatisfied, with a neutral category). Patients were classified into four categories according to responses to this item (extremely satisfied/dissatisfied, very satisfied/dissatisfied, satisfied/dissatisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied (neutral), and calculations were made for the total score and each domain of the {SATMED}-Q using standardised scores. The mean absolute differences in total score (and domains) between the neutral category and the satisfied/dissatisfied category were considered to be the {MID}. Effect sizes ({ES}) were also computed.


{RESULTS}

The {MID} for the total score was 13.4 ({ES} = 0.91), while the domain values ranged from 10.3 (medical care domain, {ES} = 0.43) to 20.6 (impact on daily living, {ES} = 0.85). Mean differences in satisfaction (as measured by the total {SATMED}-Q score and domain scores) using the levels of satisfaction established by item \#14 were significantly different, with F values ranging from 12.2 to 88.8 (p {\textless} 0.001 in all cases).


{CONCLUSION}

The {SATMED}-Q was demonstrated to be responsive to different levels of patient satisfaction with therapy in chronically ill subjects. The {MID} obtained was 13.4 points for the overall normalised scoring scale, and between 10.3 and 20.6 points for domains.},

	abstract = {{UNLABELLED}

{ABSTRACT}:


{BACKGROUND}

Hospital length of stay ({LOS}) and time for a patient to reach clinical stability ({TCS}) have increasingly become important outcomes when investigating ways in which to combat Community Acquired Pneumonia ({CAP}). Difficulties arise when deciding how to handle in-hospital mortality. Ad-hoc approaches that are commonly used to handle time to event outcomes with mortality can give disparate results and provide conflicting conclusions based on the same data. To ensure compatibility among studies investigating these outcomes, this type of data should be handled in a consistent and appropriate fashion.


{METHODS}

Using both simulated data and data from the international Community Acquired Pneumonia Organization ({CAPO}) database, we evaluate two ad-hoc approaches for handling mortality when estimating the probability of hospital discharge and clinical stability: 1) restricting analysis to those patients who lived, and 2) assigning individuals who die the "worst" outcome (right-censoring them at the longest recorded {LOS} or {TCS}). Estimated probability distributions based on these approaches are compared with right-censoring the individuals who died at time of death (the complement of the Kaplan-Meier ({KM}) estimator), and treating death as a competing risk (the cumulative incidence estimator). Tests for differences in probability distributions based on the four methods are also contrasted.


{RESULTS}

The two ad-hoc approaches give different estimates of the probability of discharge and clinical stability. Analysis restricted to patients who survived is conceptually problematic, as estimation is conditioned on events that happen at a future time. Estimation based on assigning those patients who died the worst outcome (longest {LOS} and {TCS}) coincides with the complement of the {KM} estimator based on the subdistribution hazard, which has been previously shown to be equivalent to the cumulative incidence estimator. However, in either case the time to in-hospital mortality is ignored, preventing simultaneous assessment of patient mortality in addition to {LOS} and/or {TCS}. The power to detect differences in underlying hazards of discharge between patient populations differs for test statistics based on the four approaches, and depends on the underlying hazard ratio of mortality between the patient groups.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Treating death as a competing risk gives estimators which address the clinical questions of interest, and allows for simultaneous modelling of both in-hospital mortality and {TCS} / {LOS}. This article advocates treating mortality as a competing risk when investigating other time related outcomes.},

	abstract = {{UNLABELLED}

{ABSTRACT}:


{BACKGROUND}

Large-scale clinical trials with thousands of participants are often needed to evaluate the risk reductions of cardiac events and/or death. Many recent clinical trials have evaluated the incidences of cardiac events using hard endpoints, especially in cardiovascular and metabolic medicine. A high investigation cost is involved in conducting a large-scale clinical trial, and obtaining sufficient funding is essential. The infrastructural environment of clinical trials is currently inadequate in Japan. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey to address this issue. The present study sought to clarify the current situation surrounding large-scale clinical trials in terms of funding and infrastructure, and to inform discussion about improving the financial and infrastructural situation for clinical trials.


{METHODS}

We sent questionnaires to 119 sponsors of large-scale clinical trials between August 2007 and December 2007, and between July 2009 and August 2009. Answers to each question were summarized and data were statistically analyzed.


{RESULTS}

We received responses from the sponsors of 63 (52.9\%) out of 119 trials to which questionnaires were sent. The results revealed that 25 trials (39.7\%) were funded by foundations, and 21 trials (33.3\%) were funded by public agencies. All of the foundations involved in conducting clinical trials, where funding sources were specified, were funded by private organizations such as pharmaceutical companies. All of the clinical trials with a cost of {JPY} 300 million ({USD} 3.27 million) or more were funded by private organizations, and none were funded solely by public agencies. The sponsors of 23 trials (36.5\%) responded that the trial was 'not registered' to clinical trial registry.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The questionnaire responses revealed that there were still many trials whose funding sources were unclear and many sponsors were unaware of their responsibilities in managing and/or financing the costs of clinical trials. These findings indicate that further discussion is required to establish appropriate frameworks and/or rules regarding funding, while considering conflicts of interest. This discussion should take place as soon as possible to facilitate appropriate clinical trials.},

	shorttitle = {Suitability of measures of self-reported medication adherence for routine clinical use},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

There is a recognised need to build primary care medication adherence services which are tailored to patients' needs. Continuous quality improvement of such services requires a regular working method of measuring adherence in order to monitor effectiveness. Self report has been considered the method of choice for clinical use; it is cheap, relatively unobtrusive and able to distinguish between intentional and unintentional non-adherence, which have different underlying causes and therefore require different interventions. A self report adherence measure used in routine clinical practice would ideally be brief, acceptable to patients, valid, reliable, have the ability to distinguish between different types of non-adherence and be able to be completed by or in conjunction with carers where necessary.


{METHODS}

We systematically reviewed the literature in order to identify self report adherence measures currently available which are suitable for primary care and evaluate the extent to which they met the criteria described above. We searched the databases Medline, Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Pharmline, {CINAHL}, {PsycINFO} and {HaPI} to identify studies reporting the development, validation or reliability of generic adherence measures. One reviewer screened all abstracts and assessed all relevant full text articles obtained and a second reviewer screened/assessed 10\% to check reliability.


{RESULTS}

Fifty eight measures were identified. While validation data were presented in support of the vast majority of self reported measures (54/58), data for a relatively small number of measures was presented for reliability (16/58) and time to complete (3/58). Few were designed to have the ability to be completed by or in conjunction with carers and few were able to distinguish between different types of non-adherence, which limited their ability be used effectively in the continuous improvement of targeted adherence enhancing interventions. The data available suggested that patients find it easier to estimate general adherence than to report a specific number of doses missed. Visual analogue scales can be easier for patients than other types of scale but are not suitable for telephone administration.


{CONCLUSIONS}

There is a need for a measure which can be used in the routine continual quality monitoring of adherence services.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}:  {BACKGROUND}: Over the last decade there have been a number of guidelines published, aimed at improving the quality of reporting in published studies and reviews. In systematic reviews this may be measured by their compliance with the {PRISMA} statement. This review aims to evaluate the quality of reporting in published meta-analyses of diagnostic tests, using the {PRISMA} statement and establish whether there has been a measurable improvement over time. {METHODS}: Eight databases were searched for reviews published prior to 31st December 2008. Studies were selected if they evaluated a diagnostic test, measured performance, searched two or more databases, stated the search terms and inclusion criteria, and used a statistical method to summarise a test's performance. Data were extracted on the review characteristics and items of the {PRISMA} statement. To measure the change in the quality of reporting over time, {PRISMA} items for two periods of equal duration were compared. {RESULTS}: Compliance with the {PRISMA} statement was generally poor: none of the reviews completely adhered to all 27 checklist items. Of the 236 meta-analyses included following selection: only 2(1\%) reported the study protocol; 59(25\%) reported the searches used; 76(32\%) reported the results of a risk of bias assessment; and 82(35\%) reported the abstract as a structured summary. Only 11 studies were published before 2000. Thus, the impact of {QUOROM} on the quality of reporting was not evaluated. . However, the periods 2001-2004 and 2005-2008 (covering 93\% of studies) were compared using relative risks ({RR}). There was an increase in the proportion of reviews reporting on five {PRISMA} items: eligibility criteria ({RR} 1.13, 95\% {CI} 1.00 - 1.27); risk of bias across studies (methods) ({RR} 1.81, 95\% {CI} 1.34 - 2.44); study selection results ({RR} 1.48, 95\% {CI} 1.05 - 2.09); results of individual studies ({RR} 1.37, 95\% {CI} 1.09 - 1.72); risk of bias across studies (results) ({RR} 1.65, 95\% {CI} 1.20 - 2.25).  {CONCLUSION}: Although there has been an improvement in the quality of meta-analyses in diagnostic research, there are still many deficiencies in the reporting which future reviewers need to address if readers are to trust the validity of the reported findings.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}:  {BACKGROUND}: Many studies of health outcomes rely on data collected by interviewers administering highly-structured (quantitative) questionnaires to participants. Little appears to be known about the experiences of such interviewers. This paper explores interviewer experiences of working on a longitudinal study in New Zealand (the Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study - {POIS}). Interviewers administer highly-structured questionnaires to participants, usually by telephone, and enter data into a secure computer program. The research team had expectations of interviewers including: consistent questionnaire administration, timeliness, proportions of potential participants recruited and an empathetic communication style. This paper presents results of a focus group to qualitatively explore with the team of interviewers their experiences, problems encountered, strategies, support systems used and training. {METHODS}: A focus group with interviewers involved in the {POIS} interviews was held; it was audio-recorded and transcribed. The analytical method was thematic, with output intended to be descriptive and interpretive. {RESULTS}: Nine interviewers participated in the focus group (average time in interviewer role was 31 months). Key themes were: 1) the positive aspects of the quantitative interviewer role (i.e. relationships and resilience, insights gained, and  participants' feedback), 2) difficulties interviewers encountered and solutions identified (i.e. stories lost or incomplete, forgotten appointments, telling the stories, acknowledging distress, stories reflected and debriefing and support), and 3) meeting {POIS} researcher expectations (i.e. performance standards, time-keeping, dealing exclusively with the participant and maintaining privacy). {CONCLUSIONS}: Interviewers demonstrated great skill in the way they negotiated research team expectations whilst managing the relationships with participants.  Interviewers found it helpful to have a research protocol in place in the event of sensitive situations - this appeared to alleviate the pressure on interviewers to carry the burden of responsibility. Interviewers are employed to scientifically gather quantitative data, yet their effectiveness relies largely on their humanity. We propose that the personal connection generated between the interviewers and participants was important, and enabled successful follow-up rates for the study.  The enjoyment of these relationships was crucial to interviewers and helped balance the negative aspects of their role. Our results suggest that experienced quantitative interviewers endeavour, as do many qualitative researchers, to carefully and respectfully negotiate the requirements of the interview within a relationship they form with participants: being sensitive to the needs of participants and respectful of their wishes - and establishing an ethical relationship.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}:  {BACKGROUND}: Electronic patient records are generally coded using extensive sets of codes but the significance of the utilisation of individual codes may be unclear. Item response theory ({IRT}) models are used to characterise the psychometric properties of items included in tests and questionnaires. This study asked whether the properties of medical codes in electronic patient records may be characterised through the application of item response theory models.  {METHODS}: Data were provided by a cohort of 47,845 participants from 414 family practices in the {UK} General Practice Research Database ({GPRD}) with a first stroke between 1997 and 2006. Each eligible stroke code, out of a set of 202 {OXMIS} and Read codes, was coded as either recorded or not recorded for each participant. A two parameter {IRT} model was fitted using marginal maximum likelihood estimation. Estimated parameters from the model were considered to characterise each code with respect to the latent trait of stroke diagnosis. The location parameter is referred to as a calibration parameter, while the slope parameter is referred to as a discrimination parameter.  {RESULTS}: There were 79,874 stroke code occurrences available for analysis. Utilisation of codes varied between family practices with intraclass correlation coefficients of up to 0.25 for the most frequently used codes. {IRT} analyses were restricted to 110 Read codes. Calibration and discrimination parameters were estimated for 77 (70\%) codes that were endorsed for 1,942 stroke patients. Parameters were not estimated for the remaining more frequently used codes. Discrimination parameter values ranged from 0.67 to 2.78, while calibration parameters values ranged from 4.47 to 11.58. The two parameter model gave a better fit to the data than either the one- or three-parameter models. However, high chi-square values for about a fifth of the stroke codes were suggestive of poor item fit.   {CONCLUSION}: The application of item response theory models to coded electronic patient records might potentially contribute to identifying medical codes that offer poor discrimination or low calibration. This might indicate the need for improved coding sets or a requirement for improved clinical coding practice. However, in this study estimates were only obtained for a small proportion of participants and there was some evidence of poor model fit. There was also evidence of variation in the utilisation of codes between family practices raising the possibility that, in practice, properties of codes may vary for different coders.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}:  {BACKGROUND}: The therapeutic efficacy of an intervention is often assessed in clinical trials by scales measuring multiple diverse activities that are added to produce a cumulative global score. Medical communities and health care systems subsequently use these data to calculate pooled effect sizes to compare treatments. This is done because major doubt has been cast over the clinical relevance of statistically significant findings relying on p values with the potential to report chance findings. Hence in an aim to overcome this, pooling the results of clinical studies into a meta-analyses with a statistical calculus has been assumed to be a more definitive way of deciding on efficacy.  {METHODS}: We simulate the therapeutic effects as measured with additive scales in patient cohorts with different disease severity and assess the limitations of an effect size calculation of additive scales and prove the limits of meta-analyses mathematically.  {RESULTS}: We demonstrate that the major problem, which cannot be overcome by current numerical methods, is the complex nature and neurobiological foundation of clinical psychiatric endpoints in particular and additive scales in general. This is particularly relevant for endpoints used in dementia research.  'Cognition' is composed of functions such as memory, attention, orientation and many more. These individual functions decline in varied and non-linear ways. Here we demonstrate that with progressive diseases cumulative values from multidimensional scales are subject to distortion by the limitations of the additive scale. The non-linearity of the decline of function impedes the calculation of effect sizes based on cumulative values from these multidimensional scales.  {CONCLUSIONS}: Statistical analysis needs to be guided by boundaries of the biological condition. Alternatively, we suggest a different approach avoiding the error imposed by over-analysis of cumulative global scores from additive scales.},

Time to progression ({TTP}) may be more sensitive to such agents, but induces recruitment delays in multistage studies.  Early progressive disease ({EPD}) is the earliest signal of time to progression, but is less intuitive to investigators,    To study drugs with unknown anti-tumour effect, we designed the Combination Stopping Rule ({CSR}), which allows investigators to establish a hypothesis using {RR} and {TTP}, while the program also employs early progressive disease ({EPD}) to assess for drug inactivity during the first stage of study accrual.  {METHODS}: A computer program was created to generate stopping rules based on specified error rates, trial size, and {RR} and median {TTP} of interest and disinterest for a  two-stage phase {II} trial.  Rules were generated for stage {II} such that the null hypothesis (H-nul) was rejected if either {RR} or {TTP} met desired thresholds, and accepted if both did not.  Assuming an exponential distribution for progression, {EPD} thresholds were determined based on specified {TTP} values.  Stopping rules were generated for stage I such that H-nul was accepted and the study stopped if both {RR} and {EPD} were unacceptable.   {RESULTS}: Patient thresholds were generated for {RR}, median {TTP}, and {EPD} which achieved specified error rates and which allowed early stopping based on {RR} and {EPD}.  For smaller proportional differences between interesting and disinteresting values of {RR} or {TTP}, larger trials are required to maintain alpha error, and early stopping is more common with a larger first stage.   {CONCLUSION}: Stopping rules are provided for phase {II} trials for drugs which have either a desirable {RR} or {TTP}.  In addition, early stopping can be achieved using {RR} and {EPD}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Questionnaires used by health services to identify children with psychosocial problems are often rather short. The psychometric properties of such short questionnaires are mostly less than needed for an accurate distinction between children with and without problems. We aimed to assess whether a short Computerized Adaptive Test ({CAT}) can overcome the weaknesses of short written questionnaires when identifying children with psychosocial problems.


{METHOD}

We used a Dutch national data set obtained from parents of children invited for a routine health examination by Preventive Child Healthcare with 205 items on behavioral and emotional problems (n = 2,041, response 84\%). In a random subsample we determined which items met the requirements of an Item Response Theory ({IRT}) model to a sufficient degree. Using those items, item parameters necessary for a {CAT} were calculated and a cut-off point was defined. In the remaining subsample we determined the validity and efficiency of a Computerized Adaptive Test using simulation techniques, with current treatment status and a clinical score on the Total Problem Scale ({TPS}) of the Child Behavior Checklist as criteria.


{RESULTS}

Out of 205 items available 190 sufficiently met the criteria of the underlying {IRT} model. For 90\% of the children a score above or below cut-off point could be determined with 95\% accuracy. The mean number of items needed to achieve this was 12. Sensitivity and specificity with the {TPS} as a criterion were 0.89 and 0.91, respectively.


{CONCLUSION}

An {IRT}-based {CAT} is a very promising option for the identification of psychosocial problems in children, as it can lead to an efficient, yet high-quality identification. The results of our simulation study need to be replicated in a real-life administration of this {CAT}.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: 'Wikification of {GIS} by the masses' is a phrase-term first coined by Kamel Boulos in 2005, two years earlier than Goodchild's term 'Volunteered Geographic Information'. Six years later (2005-2011), {OpenStreetMap} and Google Earth ({GE}) are now full-fledged, crowdsourced 'Wikipedias of the Earth' par excellence, with millions of users contributing their own layers to {GE}, attaching photos, videos, notes and even 3-D (three dimensional) models to locations in {GE}. From using Twitter in participatory sensing and bicycle-mounted sensors in pervasive environmental sensing, to creating a 100,000-sensor geo-mashup using Semantic Web technology, to the 3-D visualisation of indoor and outdoor surveillance data in real-time and the development of next-generation, collaborative natural user interfaces that will power the spatially-enabled public health and emergency situation rooms of the future, where sensor data and citizen reports can be triaged and acted upon in  real-time by distributed teams of professionals, this paper offers a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the overlapping domains of the Sensor Web, citizen sensing and 'human-in-the-loop sensing' in the era of the Mobile and Social Web, and the roles these domains can play in environmental and public health surveillance and crisis/disaster informatics.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of an {ICD} code-based diagnosis of obesity from administrative health data relative to the gold standard measured {BMI}. {METHODS}: Linkage of a population-based survey with anthropometric measures in elementary school children in 2003 with longitudinal administrative health data (physician visits and hospital discharges 1992-2006) from the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Measured obesity was defined based on the {CDC} cut-offs applied to the measured {BMI}. An {ICD} code-based diagnosis obesity was defined as one or more {ICD}-9 (278) or {ICD}-10 code (E66-E68) of obesity from a physician visit or a hospital stay. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and health care cost estimates based on measured obesity and {ICD}-based obesity were compared. {RESULTS}: The sensitivity of an {ICD} code-based obesity diagnosis was 7.4\% using {ICD} codes between 2002 and 2004. Those correctly identified had a higher {BMI} and had higher health care utilization and costs. {CONCLUSIONS}: An {ICD} diagnosis of obesity in Canadian administrative health data grossly underestimates the true prevalence of childhood obesity and overestimates the health care cost differential between obese and non-obese children.},

To evaluate the use and reporting of adjusted analysis in randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}) and compare the quality of reporting before and after the revision of the {CONSORT} Statement in 2001.


{DESIGN}

Comparison of two cross sectional samples of published articles.


{DATA} {SOURCES}

Journal articles indexed on {PubMed} in December 2000 and December 2006.


{STUDY} {SELECTION}

Parallel group {RCTs} with a full publication carried out in humans and published in English


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Proportion of articles reported adjusted analysis; use of adjusted analysis; the reason for adjustment; the method of adjustment and the reporting of adjusted analysis results in the main text and abstract.


{RESULTS}

In both cohorts, 25\% of studies reported adjusted analysis (84/355 in 2000 vs 113/422 in 2006). Compared with articles reporting only unadjusted analyses, articles that reported adjusted analyses were more likely to specify primary outcomes, involve multiple centers, perform stratified randomization, be published in general medical journals, and recruit larger sample sizes. In both years a minority of articles explained why and how covariates were selected for adjustment (20\% to 30\%). Almost all articles specified the statistical methods used for adjustment (99\% in 2000 vs 100\% in 2006) but only 5\% and 10\%, respectively, reported both adjusted and unadjusted results as recommended in the {CONSORT} guidelines.


{CONCLUSION}

There was no evidence of change in the reporting of adjusted analysis results five years after the revision of the {CONSORT} Statement and only a few articles adhered fully to the {CONSORT} recommendations.},

	abstract = {Proving that research findings from in vitro or animal models are relevant to human diseases is a major bottleneck in medical science. Hundreds of researchers have suggested the human relevance of oncogenic mechanisms from the statistical association between gene expression markers of these mechanisms and disease outcome. Such evidence has become easier to obtain recently with the advent of microarray screens and of large public-domain genome-wide expression datasets with patient follow-up. We demonstrated that in breast cancer any set of 100 genes or more selected at random has a 90\% chance to be significantly associated with outcome. Thus, investigators are bound to find an association however whimsical their marker is. For example, we could establish outcome associations for a signature of postprandial laughter and a signature of social defeat in mice. Association was not stronger than expected at random for 28 (60\%) of 47 published breast cancer signatures. The odds of association are 5–17\% with random single gene markers—a finding relevant to older breast cancer studies. We explained these results by showing that much of the breast cancer transcriptome is correlated with proliferation, which integrates most prognostic information in this disease.},

In other words, if the same observation, experiment, or trial were done over and over with a different sample of subjects, but with the same characteristics as the original sample, 95 percent of the means from those repeated measures would fall within this range. This gives a measure of how confident we are in the original mean. It tells us not only whether the results are statistically significant because the {CI} falls totally on one side or the other of the no difference marker (0 if continuous variables; 1 if proportions), but also the actual values so that we might determine if the data seem clinically important. In contrast, the P value tells us only whether the results are statistically significant, without translating that information into values relative to the variable that was measured. Consequently, the {CI} is a better choice to describe the results of observations, experiments, or trials.},

Current reporting of improvement work in health care varies widely in both content and quality. It is against this backdrop that a group of stakeholders from a variety of disciplines has created the Standards for {QUality} Improvement Reporting Excellence, which we refer to as the {SQUIRE} publication guidelines or {SQUIRE} statement. The {SQUIRE} statement consists of a checklist of 19 items that authors need to consider when writing articles that describe formal studies of quality improvement. Most of the items in the checklist are common to all scientific reporting, but virtually all of them have been modified to reflect the unique nature of medical improvement work. This “Explanation and Elaboration” document (E \& E) is a companion to the {SQUIRE} statement. For each item in the {SQUIRE} guidelines the E \& E document provides one or two examples from the published improvement literature, followed by an analysis of the ways in which the example expresses the intent of the guideline item. As with the E \& E documents created to accompany other biomedical publication guidelines, the purpose of the {SQUIRE} E \& E document is to assist authors along the path from completion of a quality improvement project to its publication.

Reasons for this elevated risk are poorly understood and have not been examined prospectively in antipsychotic-naïve, first-episode patients. This study aims to determine which antipsychotics are associated with diabetes development in antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia patients. All antipsychotic-naïve patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in Denmark between 01 January 1997 and 31 December 2004, followed until 31 December 2007, allowing for {\textgreater}or=3 years follow-up, unless death or diabetes onset occurred. Risk factors for the time to diabetes onset were assessed, including antipsychotics taken for at least 180 defined daily doses in the first year after first antipsychotic prescription ('initial treatment'). Risk factors for diabetes incidence were assessed, including antipsychotic use within 3 months before diabetes onset or study end ('current treatment'). Of 7139 patients, followed for 6.6 years (47,297 patient years), 307 developed diabetes (annual incidence rate: 0.65\%).

However, there is dearth of evidence from low and middle income ({LAMIC}) countries, particularly in Africa. To our knowledge this is the first community based report from Africa. {METHODS}: We followed a cohort of 307 (82.1\% males) patients with schizophrenia for five years in Butajira, rural Ethiopia. Mortality was recorded using broad rating schedule as well as verbal autopsy. Standardized Mortality Ratio ({SMR}) was calculated using the mortality in the demographic and surveillance site as a reference. {RESULT}: Thirty eight (12.4\%) patients, 34 men (11.1\%) and 4 women (1.3\%), died during the five-year follow up period. The mean age ({SD}) of the deceased for both sexes was 35 (7.35). The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.69). It was 35.3 (7.4) for men and 32.3 (6.8) for women. The most common cause of death was infection, 18/38 (47.4\%) followed by severe malnutrition, 5/38 (13.2\%) and suicide 4/38 (10.5\%). The overall {SMR} was 5.98 (95\% {CI} = 4.09 to7.87).

Patients who showed improvement on the modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression-Change ({mADCS}-{CGIC}) after 12 weeks of randomized treatment with sertraline or placebo continued double-blinded treatment for an additional 12 weeks. Depression response and remission at 24 weeks were based on {mADCS}-{CGIC} score and change in Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia ({CSDD}) score. Secondary outcome measures included time to remission, nonmood neuropsychiatric symptoms, global cognition, function, and quality of life. {RESULTS}: One hundred seventeen (89.3\%) participants completed all study assessments and 74 (56.5\%; sertraline = 38, placebo = 36) completed all 24 weeks on randomized treatment. By 24 weeks, there were no between-group differences in depression response (sertraline = 44.8\%, placebo = 35.9\%; odds ratio [95\% {CI}] = 1.23 [0.64-2.35]), change in {CSDD} score (median difference = 0.6 [95\% {CI}: -2.26 to 3.46], chi2 [df = 2] = 1.03), remission rates (sertraline = 32.8\%, placebo = 21.8\%; odds ratio [95\% {CI}] = 1.61 [0.70-3.68]), or secondary outcomes. Common selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-associated adverse events, specifically diarrhea, dizziness, and dry mouth, and pulmonary serious adverse events were more frequent in sertraline-randomized patients than in placebo subjects. {CONCLUSIONS}: Sertraline treatment is not associated with delayed improvement between 12 and 24 weeks of treatment and may not be indicated for the treatment of depression of {AD}."},

These clinic data were linked with death certificate data for all individuals and survival from diagnosis was calculated. Cox regression models were constructed using the baseline covariates. {RESULTS}: The sample comprised 653 patients (459 women), mean age 77.1 years ({SD} 7.6, range 48-94 years), diagnosed with probable {AD} and treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor. In the survival analysis, age was a consistently significant predictor of survival with a gender-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.35 (95\% {CI} 1.23, 1.48) for one standard deviation increase in age. Men were at greater risk of death than women (age-adjusted {HR} 1.44, 95\% {CI} 1.19, 1.73). In a model adjusted for all study variables, Paired-Associate Learning (Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Assessment Battery) and the psychotic factor of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory were significant predictors of survival. {CONCLUSIONS}: At diagnosis, in addition to the anticipated impact of age and gender, the presence of psychotic symptoms and poor performance on paired-associate learning are also indicators of poor prognosis.

This report examines efficacy results from three 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled studies in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Multiple doses of iloperidone were studied. Active comparators (haloperidol 15 mg/d, or risperidone 4-8 mg/d) were included to confirm trial validity. The primary protocol-defined efficacy variable in Study 1 was change from baseline to end point in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores; in Studies 2 and 3, it was change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores. Results were assessed through analysis of covariance using last observation carried forward in the intent-to-treat population. In total, 1943 patients were randomized. At least 1 iloperidone dosing group in each study demonstrated significantly better efficacy than placebo (Study 1, iloperidone 12 mg/d [P = 0.047]; Study 2, 4-8 mg/d [P = 0.012] and 10-16 mg/d [P = 0.001]; and Study 3, 20-24 mg/d [P = 0.010]). Active controls were also significantly more effective than placebo in each trial, thus validating the trials. Additional analysis in patients who received active treatment for at least 2 weeks indicated comparable efficacy score reductions at 6 weeks for patients receiving iloperidone 20 to 24 mg/d versus those receiving haloperidol or risperidone. Risk for motor-related adverse events (eg, akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms) was lower with iloperidone than with risperidone and haloperidol and was generally similar to placebo.

Methods: In this 24-week, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled trial, patients with probable {AD} were randomized to one of four treatment groups: 12 mg/day rivastigmine capsules; 10 cm2 (9.5 mg/24 h) rivastigmine patch; 20 cm2 (17.4 mg/24 h) rivastigmine patch; or placebo. Primary efficacy measures were the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale—Cognitive subscale ({ADAS}-Cog) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study––Clinical Global Impression of Change ({ADCS}-{CGIC}). Results: One thousand one hundred and ninety five {AD} patients from 21 countries participated in the study. Treatment differences (vs placebo) on the {ADAS}-Cog at Week 24 in 10 cm2 patch, 20 cm2 patch and capsule groups were 1.6 (p = 0.005), 2.6 (p {\textless} 0.001) and 1.6 (p = 0.003). Treatment differences on the {ADCS}-{CGIC} were 0.3 (p = 0.01), 0.2 (p = 0.054) and 0.3 (p = 0.009). Comparison between the 10 cm2 patch and the capsule revealed non-inferiority. Rates of nausea in the 10 cm2 patch and capsule groups were 7.2\% and 23.1\%, respectively; rates of vomiting were 6.2\% and 17.0\%, respectively. Moderate or severe skin irritation occurred in ≤10\% patients across the four patch sizes (5, 10, 15 and 20 cm2). Conclusions: The target dose of 10 cm2 rivastigmine patch provides efficacy similar to the highest doses of capsules with a superior tolerability profile.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

To discover what types of scientific misconduct are most likely to influence the results of a clinical trial.


{DESIGN}

Delphi survey of expert opinion with three rounds of consultation.


{SETTING}

Non-industry clinical trial "community".


{PARTICIPANTS}

Experts identified from invitees to a previous {MRC} consultation on clinical trials. 32 out of the 40 experts approached agreed to participate.


{RESULTS}

We identified thirteen forms of scientific misconduct for which there was majority agreement ({\textgreater}50\%) that they would be likely or very likely to distort the results and majority agreement ({\textgreater}50\%) that they would be likely or very likely to occur. Of these, the over-interpretation of 'significant' findings in small trials, selective reporting and inappropriate subgroup analyses were the main themes.


{CONCLUSIONS}

According to this expert group, the most important forms of scientific misconduct in clinical trials are selective reporting and the opportunistic use of the play of chance. Data fabrication and falsification were not rated highly because it was considered that these were unlikely to occur. Registration and publication of detailed clinical trial protocols could make an important contribution to preventing scientific misconduct.},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: Incomplete ascertainment of outcomes in randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) is likely to bias final study results if reasons for unavailability of patient data are associated with the outcome of interest. The primary objective of this study is to assess the potential impact of loss to follow-up on the estimates of treatment effect. The secondary objectives are to describe, for published {RCTs}, (1) the reporting of loss to follow-up information, (2) the analytic methods used for handling loss to follow-up information, and (3) the extent of reported loss to follow-up. {METHODS}: We will conduct a systematic review of reports of {RCTs} recently published in five top general medical journals. Eligible {RCTs} will demonstrate statistically significant effect estimates with respect to primary outcomes that are patient-important and expressed as binary data. Teams of 2 reviewers will independently determine eligibility and extract relevant information from each eligible trial using standardized, pre-piloted forms. To assess the potential impact of loss to follow-up on the estimates of treatment effect we will, for varying assumptions about the outcomes of participants lost to follow-up ({LTFU}), calculate (1) the percentage of {RCTs} that lose statistical significance and (2) the mean change in effect estimate across {RCTs}. The different assumptions we will test are the following: (1) none of the {LTFU} participants had the event; (2) all {LTFU} participants had the event; (3) all {LTFU} participants in the treatment group had the event; none of those in the control group had it (worst case scenario); (4) the event incidence among {LTFU} participants (relative to observed participants) increased, with a higher relative increase in the intervention group; and (5) the event incidence among {LTFU} participants (relative to observed participants) increased in the intervention group and decreased in the control group. {DISCUSSION}: We aim to make our objectives and methods transparent. The results of this study may have important implications for both clinical trialists and users of the medical literature."},

They are not influenced by money or self interest. Similarly, researchers try to answer the important questions in medicine; specialist societies are concerned only with what is best for a population of patients; and editors of journals publish only what is true and important for medicine. Unlike people who work in the venal worlds of commerce, politics, or journalism we in healthcare are untainted by money and `the pursuit', in the words of Sigmund Freud, `... of fame and the love of beautiful women (or perhaps men)'. This is, of course, nonsense. Those who work in healthcare are human beings and just as prone as any other humans to acting in their own interest; responding to economic incentives, and stumbling into frank fraud and corruption. Anybody who has knocked around in the world and read Dante, Juvenal, Balzac and Dickens knows that this is how human beings behave. Yet somehow in medicine we have fallen prey to the fantasy that we are superhuman. We are not. We are exposed to conflicts of interest, like everybody else. Our response should not be to pretend that they do not exist, but rather to acknowledge and disclose them always—and sometimes to accept that they are so extreme that the doctor should not treat a particular patient or an author write an editorial in a medical journal."},

A total of 1664 citations were screened, 144 potentially eligible full articles were retrieved, and 37 studies met our inclusion criteria. {DATA} {EXTRACTION}: One investigator (J.E.B.) extracted data from each of the 37 studies. The main outcomes were the prevalence of specific types of industry relationships, the relation between industry sponsorship and study outcome or investigator behavior, and the process for disclosure, review, and management of financial conflicts of interest. {DATA} {SYNTHESIS}: Approximately one fourth of investigators have industry affiliations, and roughly two thirds of academic institutions hold equity in start-ups that sponsor research performed at the same institutions. Eight articles, which together evaluated 1140 original studies, assessed the relation between industry sponsorship and outcome in original research. Aggregating the results of these articles showed a statistically significant association between industry sponsorship and pro-industry conclusions (pooled Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio, 3.60; 95\% confidence interval, 2.63-4.91). Industry sponsorship was also associated with restrictions on publication and data sharing. The approach to managing financial conflicts varied substantially across academic institutions and peer-reviewed journals. {CONCLUSIONS}: Financial relationships among industry, scientific investigators, and academic institutions are widespread. Conflicts of interest arising from these ties can influence biomedical research in important ways."},

	abstract = {Excerpt: "For someone whose lack of organization has become a topic of conversation throughout academe and beyond, Thereza Imanishi-Kari has a strikingly tidy office. The Brazilian-born scientist was this past summer cleared of all charges of scientific misconduct arising from a tangled, decade-old controversy that reached into the halls of Congress and forced Nobelist David Baltimore, one of Imanishi-Kari's co-authors in a disputed scientific study, to resign as president of the Rockefeller University. Because of his indignant defense of Imanishi-Kari, the case became known as the "Baltimore affair," even though she was the only one of six collaborators to be accused of wrongdoing. Intense news coverage turned the saga into the most sensational case of alleged research fraud in U.S. history: three books about it are now in progress. Recently reinstated as an assistant professor in the pathology department at the Tufts University School of Medicine, Imanishi-Kari, currently in her early fifties, seems remarkably unbitter. Casually dressed and in an ebullient mood in her small room at the top of a cramped laboratory building in the New England Medical Center, she displays no anger toward her accusers, concluding that they should look to their consciences: "We all have to live with our mistakes." She finds it "very sad," however, that some scientists, notably Mark Ptashne of Harvard University, publicly sided with her accusers without ever discussing the evidence with her."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{OBJECTIVE}: To determine whether scientists can detect fraudulent results in published research articles and to identify corrective measures that are most effective in purging fraudulent results from the literature. {DESIGN}: Retrospective case-control study comparing articles by an author known to have published fraudulent articles, Robert A. Slutsky, {MD}, to a set of control articles. The number of non-self-citations received by each article during each calendar year (1979 through 1990) was counted. The citation numbers were transformed into scores. Each Slutsky article was assigned a score between 1 and 3 based on the number of citations received by the Slutsky article and each of its assigned control articles. Average citation numbers and scores were tracked for each year during the 11-year study period. {RESULTS}: Before Slutsky's work was publicly questioned (1975 to 1985), scientists cited his articles as frequently as they cited control articles. After Slutsky's work was questioned and reports were published in the news media (1985), scientists cited his article less frequently than they cited control articles. Citations decreased further after the University of California-San Diego published a review of the validity of Slutsky's work in 1987. Citations did not decrease after the appearance of retractions in print or in {MEDLINE}. {CONCLUSION}: Scientists do not, and probably cannot, identify published articles that are fraudulent. However, when alerted to the presence of fraudulent results in the literature, the scientific community responds by reducing the number of citations of the tainted articles. In the Slutsky case, general news articles and the three reviews published by the University of California-San Diego were most effective and retractions were least effective in purging fraudulent results from the literature."},

	abstract = {Excerpt: "Summary

Before approving a new drug, the Food and Drug Administration ({FDA})--an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services ({HHS})--assesses a drug's effectiveness. To do so, it examines information contained in a new drug application ({NDA}), including data from clinical trials in humans. Several types of trials may be used to gather this evidence. For example, superiority trials may show that a new drug is more effective than an active control--a drug known to be effective. Non-inferiority trials aim to demonstrate that the difference between the effectiveness of a new drug and an active control is small--small enough to show that the new drug is also effective. Drugs approved on this basis may provide important benefits, such as improved safety. Because non-inferiority trials are difficult to design and interpret, they have received attention within the research community and {FDA}. {FDA} has issued guidance on these trials. {GAO} was asked to examine {FDA}'s use of non-inferiority trial evidence. This report (1) identifies {NDAs} for new molecular entities--potentially innovative new drugs not {FDA}-approved in any form--that included evidence from non-inferiority trials, (2) examines the characteristics of these trials, and (3) describes {FDA}'s guidance on these trials. {GAO} reviewed {NDAs} submitted to {FDA} between fiscal year 2002 (the first full year that {FDA} documentation was available electronically) and fiscal year 2009 (the last full year of submissions), examined {FDA}'s guidance, and interviewed agency officials."},

Results: All participants achieved more heads than tails results, with 7 of the 13 participants having significantly more heads results (p ≤ 0.05). The highest proportion of heads achieved was 0.68 (95\% confidence interval 0.62–0.73, p {\textless} 0.001).Interpretation: Certain people are able to successfully manipulate the toss of a coin.

	abstract = {Purpose. To identify core disagreements between pediatric hematologists who would treat children with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ({ITP}) on initial presentation (“Treaters”) and those who would treat by observation (“Observers”), to determine whether each group’s preferred stance was consistent with each individual’s detailed perceptions, and to identify key variables in each stance. Methods. A decision model was constructed in collaboration with experts, and a detailed questionnaire was presented to a nationally representative committee of 25 pediatric hematologists. A full decision tree was specified for each respondent. Results. Nineteen (76\%) experts responded; based on preference for initial treatment, 9 were Treaters and 10 Observers. Of the 30 probability/effectiveness variables, 8—almost all concerning treatment effectiveness—had at least one statistically-significant difference between the 2 groups regarding low, best, or high estimates. To convince Observers that treatment is effective would take a clinical trial with between 39 000 and 87 000 participants; to convince Treaters that treatment is not effective enough, between 97 000 and 114 000 participants. Observers’ calculated numbers needed to treat ({NNTs}) of about 150 000 are more consistent (P = 0.0023) with their elicited maximum {NTTs} of about 500. Conclusion. Physicians not specifically trained provided enough data to specify complete individual decision models. From the estimates provided, no practical clinical trial could convince hematologists who would treat children on initial presentation with {ITP} just to simply observe them or could convince those who would just observe to instead treat with available agents. Perceived burdens could be better characterized, perhaps by including parental perceptions and preferences.},

{BACKGROUND}: One of the most commonly reported problems of randomised trials is that recruitment is usually slower than expected. Trials will cost more and take longer, thus delaying the use of the results in clinical practice, and incomplete samples imply decreased statistical power and usefulness of its results. We aim to identify barriers and facilitators for successful patient recruitment at the level of the patient, the doctor and the hospital organization as well as the organization and design of trials over a broad range of studies. {METHODS}/{DESIGN}: We will perform two cohort studies and a case-control study in The Netherlands. The first cohort study will report on a series of multicenter trials performed in a nationwide network of clinical trials in obstetrics and gynaecology. A questionnaire will be sent to all clinicians recruiting for these trials to identify determinants--aggregated at centre level--for the recruitment rate. In a case control-study nested in this cohort we will interview patients who refused or consented participation to identify factors associated with patients' consent or refusal. In a second cohort study, we will study trials that were prospectively registered in the Netherlands Trial Register. Using a questionnaire survey we will assess whether issues on hospital organization, trial organization, planning and trial design were associated with successful recruitment, i.e. 80\% of the predefined number of patients recruited within the planned time. {DISCUSSION}: This study will provide insight in barriers and facilitators for successful patient recruitment in trials. The results will be used to provide recommendations and a checklist for individual trialists to identify potential pitfalls for recruitment and judge the feasibility prior to the start of the study. Identified barriers and motivators coupled to evidence-based interventions can improve recruitment of patients in clinical trials."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{OBJECTIVES}: To identify factors associated with good and poor recruitment to multicentre trials. {DATA} {SOURCES}: Part A: database of trials started in or after 1994 and were due to end before 2003 held by the Medical Research Council and Health Technology Assessment Programmes. Part B: interviews with people playing a wide range of roles within four trials that their funders identified as 'exemplars'. Part C: a large multicentre trial (the {CRASH} trial) of treatment for head injury. {REVIEW} {METHODS}: The study used a number of different perspectives ('multiple lenses'), and three components. Part A: an epidemiological review of a cohort of trials. Part B: case studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment. Part C: a single, in-depth case study to examine the feasibility of applying a business-orientated analytical framework as a reference model in future trials. {RESULTS}: In the 114 trials found in Part A, less than one-third recruited their original target within the time originally specified, and around one-third had extensions. Factors observed more often in trials that recruited successfully were: having a dedicated trial manager, being a cancer or drug trial, and having interventions only available inside the trial. The most commonly reported strategies to improve recruitment were newsletters and mailshots, but it was not possible to assess whether they were causally linked to changes in recruitment. The analyses in Part B suggested that successful trials were those addressing clinically important questions at a timely point. The investigators were held in high esteem by the interviewees, and the trials were firmly grounded in existing clinical practices, so that the trial processes were not alien to clinical collaborators, and the results could be easily applicable to future practice. The interviewees considered that the needs of patients were well served by participation in the trials. Clinical collaborators particularly appreciated clear delineation of roles, which released them from much of the workload associated with trial participation. There was a strong feeling from interviewees that they were proud to be part of a successful team. This pride fed into further success. Good groundwork and excellent communications across many levels of complex trial structures were considered to be extremely important, including training components for learning about trial interventions and processes, and team building. All four trials had faced recruitment problems, and extra insights into the working of trials were afforded by strategies invoked to address them. The process of the case study in Part C was able to draw attention to a body of research and practice in a different discipline (academic business studies). It generated a reference model derived from a combination of business theory and work within {CRASH}. This enabled identification of weaker managerial components within {CRASH}, and initiatives to strengthen them. Although it is not clear, even within {CRASH}, whether the initiatives that follow from developing and applying the model will be effective in increasing recruitment or other aspects of the success of the trial, the reference model could provide a template, with potential for those managing other trials to use or adapt it, especially at foundation stages. The model derived from this project could also be used as a diagnostic tool if trials have difficulties and hence as a basis for deciding what type of remedial action to take. It may also be useful for auditing the progress of trials, such as during external review. {CONCLUSIONS}: While not producing sufficiently definitive results to make strong recommendations, the work here suggests that future trials should consider the different needs at different phases in the life of trials, and place greater emphasis on 'conduct' (the process of actually doing trials). This implies learning lessons from successful trialists and trial managers, with better training for issues relating to trial conduct. The complexity of large trials means that unanticipated difficulties are highly likely at some time in every trial. Part B suggested that successful trials were those flexible and robust enough to adapt to unexpected issues. Arguably, the trialists should also expect agility from funders within a proactive approach to monitoring ongoing trials. Further research into different recruitment patterns (including 'failures') may help to clarify whether the patterns seen in the 'exemplar' trials differ or are similar. The reference model from Part C needs to be further considered in other similar and different trials to assess its robustness. These and other strategies aimed at increasing recruitment and making trials more successful need to be formally evaluated for their effectiveness in a range of trials."},

To test if monitoring with {CUSUM} control lines is practical and useful as a prompt to stop the drug trial early, if the study drug performs significantly worse than the comparator drug. Design: Prospective, open label, controlled trial using standard therapy (epinephrine) and study drug (hypertonic-saline) sequentially in two groups of patients. Setting: Hospital offering tertiary-level pediatric care. Patients: Children, 2 months to 2 years, with first episode of bronchiolitis, excluding those with cardiac disease, immunodeficiency and critical illness at presentation. Interventions: Nebulised epinephrine in first half of the bronchiolitis season (n = 35) and hypertonic saline subsequently (n = 29). Continuous monitoring of response to hypertonic-saline using {CUSUM} control-chart developed with epinephrine-response data. Main outcome measures: Clinical score, tachycardia and total duration of hospital stay. Results: In the epinephrine group, the maximum {CUSUM} was +2.25 ({SD} 1.34) and minimum {CUSUM} was -2.26 ({SD} 1.34). {CUSUM} score with hypertonic-saline group stayed above the zero line throughout the study. There was no statistical difference in the post-treatment clinical score at 24 hours between the treatment groups \{Mean ({SD}) 3.516 (2.816): 3.552 (2.686); 95\% {CI}: -1.416 to + 1.356\}, heart rate \{Mean ({SD}) 136 (44): 137(12); 95\% {CI}: -17.849 to +15.849) or duration of hospital stay (Mean ({SD}) 96.029 (111.41): 82.914 (65.940); 95\% {CI}: -33.888 to +60.128\}. Conclusions: The software we developed allows for drawing of control lines to monitor study drug performance.

However, few physical activity questionnaires have been validated in Asian populations. We previously utilized a combination of different questionnaires to assess leisure time, transportation, occupational and household physical activity in the Singapore Prospective Study Program ({SP}2).  The International Physical Activity Questionnaire ({IPAQ}) has been developed for a similar purpose.  In this study, we compared estimates from these two questionnaires with an objective measure of physical activity in a multi-ethnic Asian population. {METHODS}: Physical activity was measured in 152 Chinese, Malay and Asian Indian adults using an  accelerometer over five consecutive days, including a weekend.  Participants completed both the physical activity questionnaire in {SP}2 ({SP}2PAQ) and {IPAQ} long form.  43 subjects underwent a second set of measurements on average 6 months later to assess reproducibility of the questionnaires and the accelerometer measurements. Spearman correlations were used to evaluate validity and reproducibility and correlations for validity were corrected for within-person variation of accelerometer measurements. Agreement between the questionnaires and the accelerometer measurements was also evaluated using Bland Altman plots. {RESULTS}: The corrected correlation with accelerometer estimates of energy expenditure from physical activity was better for the {SP}2PAQ (vigorous activity: r=0.73; moderate activity: r=0.27) than for the {IPAQ} (vigorous activity: r=0.31; moderate activity: r=0.15). For moderate activity, the corrected correlation between {SP}2PAQ and the accelerometer was higher for Chinese (r=0.38) and Malays (r=0.57) than for Indians (r=-0.09). Both questionnaires overestimated energy expenditure from physical activity to a greater extent at higher levels of physical activity than at lower levels of physical activity. The reproducibility for moderate activity (accelerometer: r=0.68; {IPAQ}: r=0.58; {SP}2PAQ: r=0.55) and vigorous activity (accelerometer: 0.52; {IPAQ}: r=0.38; {SP}2PAQ: r=0.75) was moderate to high for all instruments. {CONCLUSION}: The agreement between {IPAQ} and accelerometer measurements of energy expenditure from physical activity was poor in our Asian study population. The {SP}2PAQ showed good validity and reproducibility for vigorous activity, but performed less well for moderate activity particularly in Indians. Further effort is needed to develop questionnaires that better capture moderate activity in Asian populations."},

Slow accrual is of particular concern when it leads to reduced sample size. Although accrual in clinical trials has been studied and its estimation has been proposed and implemented, the existing methods are usually over-simplified by assuming a constant or piecewise constant accrual rate, and more flexible and realistic methods are needed. In this paper, we discuss a principled framework to monitor and predict trial accrual. We model trial accrual using a non-homogeneous Poisson process and model the underlying time-dependent accrual rate using cubic B-splines. The statistical inference and prediction procedure for the model are studied in a Bayesian paradigm. We conduct simulation studies to investigate the performance of the proposed approach and compare with a constant accrual rate model discussed by Gajewski et al. (Statist. Med. 2008; 27: 2328-2340). With satisfactory results, we illustrate the proposed method using accrual data from a real oncology trial. Our results show that the proposed model is more robust and achieves substantially better performance compared with the existing methods."},

In this study, Monte Carlo methods were used to examine the performance, with respect to fixed theoretical levels of explained variance and explained risk, of eight R²analogues. The {McKelvey}-Zavoina measure appears to be best at estimating explained variance and either the sample-estimated explained risk or the ordinary least squares R²to be best at indexing explained risk.

The purpose of this project was to gain a better understanding of reported {PVs}, to describe current practice with regards to the use of methods for the reduction of {PVs} and to investigate relationships between clinical trial characteristics and {PVs}. {METHODS}: We reviewed 80 clinical trials conducted across a broad range of medical specialties published in four major general medical journals (The Lancet, {NEJM}, {JAMA}, {BMJ}). Eligible papers were identified using a {PubMed} search. For each included trial, two authors independently abstracted information on trial characteristics, {PV} reporting and {PV} rates and interventions used to reduce {PVs}. {PVs} were categorised into one of five distinct types: enrolment, randomisation, study intervention, patient compliance and data collection errors. Associations between {PVs} and study characteristics were investigated using logistic regression. {RESULTS}: Eighty clinical trials (20 from each journal) were identified from 101 consecutive {PubMed} abstracts. The median number of participants was 701 (range: 20 to 162,367) and the median number of participating sites was 15 (range: 1 to 701). Nineteen percent (15/80) of included trials were single centre trials. The median study duration was 24 months (range: 5.81 - 127 months) and 74\% (59/80) of included trials were primarily academic funded. Thirty two percent (26/80) of included trials failed to provide explicit reporting of any type of {PV} and none (0/80) of the trials provided explicit reporting of all five types of {PVs}. Larger clinical trials (more patients, more sites, longer duration, more complex management structure) were more likely to have more complete reporting of {PV}'s.  Only 9\% (7/80) of trials reported the use of a specific study method to prevent {PVs}. Use of a run-in phase was the only method reported.  {CONCLUSIONS}: {PVs} are under-reported. Although the {CONSORT} statement provides guidance on the reporting of {PVs}, reporting requirements are not explicit for all types of {PVs}. As a first step towards improved reporting by authors, we recommend the {CONSORT} statement highlight the importance of {PVs} by making reporting requirements more explicit."},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: "{BACKGROUND}: Questionnaires are used extensively in medical and health care research and depend on validity and reliability. However, participants may differ in interest and awareness throughout long questionnaires, which can affect reliability of their answers. A method is proposed for "screening" of systematic change in random error, which could assess changed reliability of answers. {METHODS}: A simulation study was conducted to explore whether systematic change in reliability, expressed as changed random error, could be assessed using unsupervised classification of subjects by cluster analysis ({CA}) and estimation of intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC}). The method was also applied on a clinical dataset from 753 cardiac patients using the Jalowiec Coping Scale. {RESULTS}: The simulation study showed a relationship between the systematic change in random error throughout a questionnaire and the slope between the estimated {ICC} for subjects classified by {CA} and successive items in a questionnaire. This slope was proposed as an awareness measure - to assessing if respondents provide only a random answer or one based on a substantial cognitive effort. Scales from different factor structures of Jalowiec Coping Scale had different effect on this awareness measure.  {CONCLUSIONS}: Even though assumptions in the simulation study might be limited compared to real datasets, the approach is promising for assessing systematic change in reliability throughout long questionnaires. Results from a clinical dataset indicated that the awareness measure differed between scales."},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: "{BACKGROUND}: The Millennium Cohort Study is a longitudinal cohort study designed in the late 1990s to evaluate how military service may affect long-term health.  The purpose of this investigation was to examine characteristics of Millennium Cohort Study participants who responded to the open-ended question, and to identify and investigate the most commonly reported areas of concern. {METHODS}: Participants who responded during the 2001-2003 and 2004-2006 questionnaire cycles were included in this study (n = 108,129).  To perform these analyses, Latent Semantic Analysis ({LSA}) was applied to a broad open-ended question asking the participant if there were any additional health concerns.  Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the adjusted odds of responding to the open-text field, and cluster analysis was executed to understand the major areas of concern for participants providing open-ended responses. {RESULTS}: Participants who provided information in the open-ended text field (n = 27,916), had significantly lower self-reported general health compared with those who did not provide information in the open-ended text field.  The bulk of responses concerned a finite number of topics, most notably illness/injury, exposure, and exercise. {CONCLUSION}: These findings suggest generalized topic areas, as well as identify subgroups who are more likely to provide additional information in their response that may add insight into future epidemiologic and military research."},
