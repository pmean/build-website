	abstract = {Image labeling and parcellation are critical tasks for the assessment of volumetric and morphometric features in medical imaging data. The process of image labeling is inherently error prone as images are corrupted by noise and artifact. Even expert interpretations are subject to subjectivity and the precision of the individual raters. Hence, all labels must be considered imperfect with some degree of inherent variability. One may seek multiple independent assessments to both reduce this variability as well as quantify the degree of uncertainty. Existing techniques exploit maximum a posteriori statistics to combine data from multiple raters. A current limitation with these approaches is that they require each rater to generate a complete dataset, which is often impossible given both human foibles and the typical turnover rate of raters in a research or clinical environment. Herein, we propose a robust set of extensions that allow for missing data, account for repeated label sets, and utilize training/catch trial data. With these extensions, numerous raters can label small, overlapping portions of a large dataset, and rater heterogeneity can be robustly controlled while simultaneously estimating a single, reliable label set and characterizing uncertainty. The proposed approach enables parallel processing of labeling tasks and reduces the otherwise detrimental impact of rater unavailability.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Recent reports have suggested that 40\% or more of National Cancer Institute ({NCI}) –sponsored Cooperative Group phase {III} trials failed to achieve their accrual goals. We examine in detail the accrual experience of the Cooperative Group phase {III} trials.

Patients and Methods
All Cooperative Group phase {III} trials activated from 2000 to 2007 were examined for their accrual experience. For trials that stopped accrual with {\textless} 90\% of their accrual goal, the reasons for having {\textless} 90\% accrual were documented. We focus on trials that ended with {\textless} 90\% accrual because of inadequate accrual rates rather than for other reasons, such as an interim monitoring analysis by an independent data monitoring committee that stops the trial early because one treatment is clearly superior.

Results
There were 191 trials activated from 2000 to 2007. We project that 22.0\% of these trials will have {\textless} 90\% accrual because of inadequate accrual rates. We project that there will be 176,627 patients eventually accrued on the 191 trials (current accrual, 154,579) and that 2,991of these patients will be on trials that have {\textless} 90\% accrual because of inadequate accrual rates (1.7\%). For nonpediatric cancer trials, the corresponding percentages are 26.7\% and 2.0\%.

Conclusion
We find that insufficient accrual rates are not as high as previously reported and that only a small proportion of patients were enrolled on trials that ended with insufficient accrual because of an inadequate accrual rate. {NCI} has implemented new procedures to reduce the number of trials that fail to reach their accrual goals and to minimize the number of patients accrued on these trials.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A major challenge for randomized phase {III} oncology trials is the frequent low rates of patient enrollment, resulting in high rates of premature closure due to insufficient accrual.
{PURPOSE}: We conducted a pilot study to determine the extent of trial closure due to poor accrual, feasibility of identifying trial factors associated with sufficient accrual, impact of redesign strategies on trial accrual, and accrual benchmarks designating high failure risk in the clinical trials cooperative group ({CTCG}) setting.
{METHODS}: A subset of phase {III} trials opened by five {CTCGs} between August 1991 and March 2004 was evaluated. Design elements, experimental agents, redesign strategies, and pretrial accrual assessment supporting accrual predictions were abstracted from {CTCG} documents. Percent actual/predicted accrual rate averaged per month was calculated. Trials were categorized as having sufficient or insufficient accrual based on reason for trial termination. Analyses included univariate and bivariate summaries to identify potential trial factors associated with accrual sufficiency.
{RESULTS}: Among 40 trials from one {CTCG}, 21 (52.5\%) trials closed due to insufficient accrual. In 82 trials from five {CTCGs}, therapeutic trials accrued sufficiently more often than nontherapeutic trials (59\% vs 27\%, p = 0.05). Trials including pretrial accrual assessment more often achieved sufficient accrual than those without (67\% vs 47\%, p = 0.08). Fewer exclusion criteria, shorter consent forms, other {CTCG} participation, and trial design simplicity were not associated with achieving sufficient accrual. Trials accruing at a rate much lower than predicted ({\textless}35\% actual/predicted accrual rate) were consistently closed due to insufficient accrual.
{LIMITATIONS}: This trial subset under-represents certain experimental modalities. Data sources do not allow accounting for all factors potentially related to accrual success.
{CONCLUSION}: Trial closure due to insufficient accrual is common. Certain trial design factors appear associated with attaining sufficient accrual. Defining accrual benchmarks for early trial termination or redesign is feasible, but better accrual prediction methods are critically needed. Future studies should focus on identifying trial factors that allow more accurate accrual predictions and strategies that can salvage open trials experiencing slow accrual.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The need to increase the number oncology clinical trials with sufficient enrollments is a well-known issue, particularly for trials targeting therapeutic applications. It is critical to identify early predictors of eventual study accrual achievement.
Experimental Design: All nonpediatric phase I, I/{II}, {II}, and {III} therapeutic studies supported by the National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ({NCI}-{CTEP}) between 2000 and 2007 (n = 764) were analyzed for accrual performance. Accrual achievement is defined as those enrolling 100\% or more of the stated minimum accrual goal at the time of trial closure. Two accrual milestones were analyzed per trial: time to first patient enrollment and expected time to accrual goal. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the {OR} with respect to the likelihood of clinical trial accrual achievement.
Results: A total of 81.5\% (n = 623) of the trials did not achieve the projected accrual goals within the anticipated accruing period. Furthermore, 37.2\% (n = 284) of trials failed to achieve the minimum projected accrual at study closure regardless of time the trial was open. Trials that accrue the first enrollment beyond 2 months (n = 379, 49.6\%) are significantly less likely to achieve the accrual performance than those trials that enroll patients under 2 months ({OR}: 0.637, 95\% {CI}: 0.464–0.875, P = 0.005). Of the studies that are open beyond the anticipated enrollment period (n = 603), those do not achieve at least 60.0\% of the projected minimum accrual (n = 391, 64.8\%) have a significantly less likelihood of achieving final accruals by study closure ({OR}: 0.190, 95\% {CI}: 0.055–0.652, P = 0.008).
Conclusions: The time to first patient enrollment and expected time to accrual goal are shown to be valid measures to evaluate the likelihood of achieving the minimum projected accrual. Clin Cancer Res; 17(7); 1947–55. ©2011 {AACR}.},

	abstract = {A recent international survey on the size of clinical trials in cancer showed the frequent problem of slow patient accrual, which remains a major hindrance to progress. The survey also revealed that, although the design of most trials specified a fixed number of patients, subsequent experience revealed a much more flexible approach, with analysis of results, say, every 4--6 months. Conventional sequential methods are hardly ever used and unfortunately most trials proceed without any predetermined stopping rules. Some trial organizers use repeated significance tests on accumulating data as a guide to the detection of treatment differences, an approach that can be adapted to a more rigorous statistical framework as a "group sequential design". The major statistical principle involved is that the more often one analyses the data the greater is the probability of achieving a statistically significant result, even when the two treatments are equally effective. Group sequential designs require the adoption of a more stringent significance level to allow for repeated testing. If one intends up to 10 repeated analyses of the data, only a treatment difference significant at the 1\% level would merit a decision to stop the trial. For any trial to implement a stopping rule successfully there must also be prompt feedback and processing of response and survival data ready for up-to-date analysis. Such efficiency is often lacking. The repeated presentation of interim results of a trial to participating investigators can seriously affect their future reaction, especially if there are interesting but non-significant differences. Thus, some secrecy about ongoing results is advisable if trials are to achieve an unbiased conclusion.},

	abstract = {Future progress in improving cancer therapy can be expedited by better prioritization of new treatments for phase {III} evaluation. Historically, phase {II} trials have been key components in the prioritization process. There has been a long-standing interest in using phase {II} trials with randomization against a standard-treatment control arm or an additional experimental arm to provide greater assurance than afforded by comparison to historic controls that the new agent or regimen is promising and warrants further evaluation. Relevant trial designs that have been developed and utilized include phase {II} selection designs, randomized phase {II} designs that include a reference standard-treatment control arm, and phase {II}/{III} designs. We present our own explorations into the possibilities of developing "phase {II} screening trials," in which preliminary and nondefinitive randomized comparisons of experimental regimens to standard treatments are made (preferably using an intermediate end point) by carefully adjusting the false-positive error rates (alpha or type I error) and false-negative error rates (beta or type {II} error), so that the targeted treatment benefit may be appropriate while the sample size remains restricted. If the ability to conduct a definitive phase {III} trial can be protected, and if investigators feel that by judicious choice of false-positive probability and false-negative probability and magnitude of targeted treatment effect they can appropriately balance the conflicting demands of screening out useless regimens versus reliably detecting useful ones, the phase {II} screening trial design may be appropriate to apply.},

	doi = {10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1633},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Assessing impact of poor accrual on premature trial closure requires a relevant metric. We propose defining accrual sufficiency on apparent ability to address primary endpoints ({PE}) rather than attaining accrual targets.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: All phase {III} trials open January 1, 1993, to December 31, 2002, by five U.S. oncology Clinical Trials Cooperative Groups ({CTCG}) were evaluated for accrual sufficiency and scientific results. Sufficient accrual included meeting accrual target, {CTCGs} documentation attesting adequate accrual, or conclusive results at interim analysis; insufficient accrual included poor accrual as cited closure reason or other reasons rendering a trial unable to address its primary endpoints. Closure rates based on our accrual sufficiency definition are compared with rates of meeting accrual targets and addressing the primary endpoints. A percentage of target accrual above which trials commonly answer the intended scientific question was identified to serve as an alternative to meeting full target accrual in designating accrual success.
{RESULTS}: Of 238 eligible trials, 158 (66\%) closed with sufficient accrual. Among 80 trials with insufficient accrual, 70 (29\%) closed specifically because of poor accrual. Inadequate accrual rates are overemphasized when defining accrual success solely by meeting accrual targets. Nearly 75\% of trials conclusively addressed the primary endpoints with positive results in 39\% of trials. Exceeding 80\% of target accrual serves as a reliable proxy for answering the intended scientific question.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Approximately one third of phase {III} trials closed with insufficient accrual to address the primary endpoints, primarily due to poor accrual. Defining accrual sufficiency broader than meeting accrual targets represents a fairer account of trial closures.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Research on barriers to accrual has typically emphasized factors influencing participation after trial activation.
{PURPOSE}: We sought to identify factors influencing trial design and accrual predictions prior to trial activation associated with sufficient accrual.
{METHODS}: A 30-question web-based survey was sent to the study chair and lead statistician for all 248 phase {III} trials open in 1993-2002 by five Clinical Trials Cooperative Groups. Questions addressed prior trial experience, trial design elements, accrual predictions, and perceived accrual influences. Accrual sufficiency categorization was derived from Clinical Trials Cooperative Group records: sufficient accrual included trials closed with complete accrual or at interim analysis, insufficient accrual included trials closed with inadequate accrual. Responses were analyzed by respondent role (study chair/lead statistician) and accrual sufficiency.
{RESULTS}: Three hundred and nine eligible responses were included (response rate, 63\%; lead statisticians, 81\%; and study chairs, 45\%), representing trials with sufficient (63\%) and insufficient accruals (37\%). Study chair seniority or lead statistician experience was not linked to accrual sufficiency. Literature review, study chair's personal experience, and expert opinion within Clinical Trials Cooperative Group most commonly influenced control arm selection. Clinical Trials Cooperative Group experience most influenced accrual predictions. These influences were not associated with accrual sufficiency. Among respondents citing accrual difficulties (41\%), factors negatively influencing accrual were not consistently identified. Respondents credited three factors with positively influencing accrual: clinical relevance of study, lack of competing trials, and protocol paralleling normal practice.
{LIMITATIONS}: Perceptions of lead statisticians and study chairs may not accurately reflect accrual barriers encountered by participating physicians or patients. Survey responses may be subject to recall bias.
{CONCLUSION}: Consistent factors explaining poor accrual were not identified, suggesting reasons for poor accrual are not well understood and warrant further study. Alternate strategies for accrual prediction are needed since Clinical Trials Cooperative Group experience is linked to successful and unsuccessful accrual.},

	abstract = {We propose a Bayesian formulation of the sample size problem for planning clinical trials. The frequentist paradigm for calculating sample sizes for clinical trials is to prespecify the type I and {II} error probabilities. These error probabilities are conditional on the true hypotheses. Instead we propose prespecifying posterior probabilities which are conditional on the outcome of the trial. Our method is easy to implement and has intuitive interpretations. We illustrate an application of our method to the planning of cancer clinical trials for the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ({ECOG}).},

	abstract = {Less than one third of publicly funded trials managed to recruit according to their original plan often resulting in request for additional funding and/or time extensions. The aim was to identify models which might be useful to a major public funder of randomised controlled trials when estimating likely time requirements for recruiting trial participants. The requirements of a useful model were identified as usability, based on experience, able to reflect time trends, accounting for centre recruitment and contribution to a commissioning decision.

Many methods have been studied, including models based on Poisson process and its large sample approximation by Brownian motion ({BM}); however, when the independent incremental structure is violated for {BM} model, we could use fractional Brownian motion to model and approximate the underlying Poisson processes with random rates. In this paper, fractional Brownian motion ({FBM}) is considered for such conditions and compared to {BM} model with illustrated examples from different trials and simulations.},

The analytic technique for predicting the number of patients recruited in different centers/regions for ongoing trials accounting for possible delays and closure of some centers is developed. The asymptotic properties of the recruitment in particular regions are investigated and the analysis of recruitment performance in centers/regions is provided. The approximations and predictive confidence bounds for the number of randomized patients in some region using center-stratified randomization are derived. These results are used for creating software tools for predictive patient recruitment and drug supply modeling in {GlaxoSmithKline}.},

Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow.
