	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: The National Database for Nursing Quality Indicators(R) ({NDNQI}(R)) was established in 1998 to assist hospitals in monitoring indicators of nursing quality (eg, falls and pressure ulcers). Hospitals participating in {NDNQI} transmit data from nursing units to an {NDNQI} data repository. Data are summarized and published in reports that allow participating facilities to compare the results for their units with those from other units across the nation. A disadvantage of this reporting scheme is that the sampling variability is not explicit. For example, suppose a small nursing unit that has 2 out of 10 (rate of 20\%) patients with pressure ulcers. Should the nursing unit immediately undertake a quality improvement plan because of the rate difference from the national average (7\%). {METHODS}: In this paper, we propose approximating 95\% credible intervals ({CrIs}) for unit-level data using statistical models that account for the variability in unit rates for report cards. {RESULTS}: Bayesian {CrIs} communicate the level of uncertainty of estimates more clearly to decision makers than other significance tests. {CONCLUSION}: A benefit of this approach is that nursing units would be better able to distinguish problematic or beneficial trends from fluctuations likely due to chance."},

	abstract = {Abstract: "{BACKGROUND}: In high throughput screening, such as differential gene expression screening, drug sensitivity screening, and genome-wide {RNAi} screening, tens of thousands of tests need to be conducted simultaneously. However, the number of replicate measurements per test is extremely small, rarely exceeding 3. Several current approaches demonstrate that test statistics with shrinking variance estimates have more power over the traditional t statistic. {RESULTS}: We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to incorporate the shrinkage concept by introducing a mixture structure on variance components. The estimates from the Bayesian model are utilized in the optimal discovery procedure ({ODP}) proposed by Storey in 2007, which was shown to have optimal performance in multiple significance tests. We compared the performance of the Bayesian {ODP} with several competing test statistics. {CONCLUSION}: We have conducted simulation studies with 2 to 6 replicates per gene. We have also included test results from two real datasets. The Bayesian {ODP} outperforms the other methods in our study, including the original {ODP}. The advantage of the Bayesian {ODP} becomes more significant when there are few replicates per test. The improvement over the original {ODP} is based on the fact that Bayesian model borrows strength across genes in estimating unknown parameters. The proposed approach is efficient in computation due to the conjugate structure of the Bayesian model. The R code (see Additional file 1) to calculate the Bayesian {ODP} is provided."},
