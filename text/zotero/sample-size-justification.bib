	shorttitle = {The Australian '{FORM}' Approach to Guideline Development},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Clinical practice guidelines have been defined as systematically developed
statements to assist practitioner and patient decision-making about appropriate health care for
specific clinical circumstances. They play an important role in guiding evidence based clinical
practice. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council has developed and pilottested
a new framework for guideline development, the {FORM} approach, the role of which has
yet to be further defined.{METHODS}:We critically review the elements of the {FRAME} approach and compare it to other,
more established methods for rating the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations.{RESULTS}:{FORM} recognizes five factors that impact the strength of a recommendation which are
the evidence base, consistency, clinical impact, generalizability and applicability. Consideration
of these elements leads to a four-tiered rating system represented by the letters A ("body of
evidence can be trusted to guide practice") to D ("body of evidence is weak and
recommendation must be applied with caution"). It builds on other existing guideline
methodologies such as those developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network
({SIGN}), the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy ({SORT}) and the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ({GRADE}) groups. {FORM}
distinguishes itself from other systems by its strong emphasis on applicability, which is
separated out as its own category and relates the relevance of the body of evidence to the
Australian healthcare system.{CONCLUSIONS}:The {FORM} approach offers a methodologically rigorous alternative approach to
guideline development that places particular emphasis on aspects of applicability. This feature
is unique and may prompt future adoption by other guidelines systems},

	shorttitle = {Evidence-based effect size estimation},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Estimating a realistic effect size is an important issue in the planning of clinical studies of complementary and alternative medicine therapies. When a minimally important difference is not available, researchers may estimate effect size using the published literature. This evidence-based effect size estimation may be used to produce a range of empirically-informed effect size and consequent sample size estimates. We provide an illustration of deriving plausible effect size ranges for a study of acupuncture in the relief of post-chemotherapy fatigue in breast cancer patients.{METHODS}:A {PubMed} search identified three uncontrolled studies reporting the effect of acupuncture in relieving fatigue. A separate search identified five randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) with a wait-list control of breast cancer patients receiving standard care that reported data on fatigue. We use these published data to produce best, average, and worst-case effect size estimates and related sample size estimates for a trial of acupuncture in the relief of cancer-related fatigue relative to a wait-list control receiving standard care.{RESULTS}:Use of evidence-based effect size estimation to calculate sample size requirements for a study of acupuncture in relieving fatigue in breast cancer survivors relative to a wait-list control receiving standard care suggests that an adequately-powered phase {III} randomized controlled trial comprised of two arms would require at least 101 subjects (52 per arm) if a strong effect is assumed for acupuncture and 235 (118 per arm) if a moderate effect is assumed.{CONCLUSION}:Evidence-based effect size estimation helps justify assumptions in light of empirical evidence and can lead to more realistic sample size calculations, an outcome that would be of great benefit for the field of complementary and alternative medicine.},
