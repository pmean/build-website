	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Multiple imputation ({MI}) is an advanced, principled method of dealing with missing data in statistical analyses, a common problem in medical research. This paper sought to document the use of {MI} in general medical journals and to evaluate the information provided to readers about the application of the procedure in studies.
{METHODS}: Research articles using {MI} in analyses published in {JAMA}, New England Journal of Medicine, {BMJ} and the Lancet were identified using full text searches from the earliest date each journal offered such searches until the end of 2008. Ninety-nine articles were found. Studies were classified according to their design.
{RESULTS}: Multiple imputation was used in 49 {RCTs} and 50 other types of studies. A third of the articles (n = 33) reported no details of the procedure used. In a third of these (n = 11), it was not possible to infer the approach used from references cited or software used. The nature of the imputation model was rarely reported. {MI} was frequently used as a secondary analysis (n = 40) either to justify reporting a simpler approach or as a form of sensitivity analysis.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Whilst still relatively uncommon, the use of {MI} has risen substantially, particularly in trials. {MI} is rarely adequately reported, leading to doubt about its appropriateness in some cases. This gives rise to uncertainty about conclusions reached and poses a barrier to attempts to replicate analyses. Guidelines for the reporting of {MI} should be developed.},
