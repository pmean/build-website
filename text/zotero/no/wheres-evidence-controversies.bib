But a rumbling note of uneasiness underlines present-day medical progress: the more we know, The more questions we encounter about what to do with the hard-won information. The essays in Where's the Evidence examine the dilemmas that have arisen as the result of medicine's unprecedented increase in technical powers. How do doctors draw the line between "knowing" (the acquisition of new medical information) and doing" (the application of that new knowledge)? What are the long-term consequences of responding to the demand that physicians always do everything that can be done? Is medicine's primary aim to increase the length of life? Or is it to reduce the amount of pain and suffering? And who is empowered to choose when these ends are mutually exclusive? This engaging collection of essays will be of interest to professionals interested in the evidence-based medicine debate, including epidemiologists, neonatologists, those involved in clinical trials and health policy, medical ethicists, medical students, and trainees.
