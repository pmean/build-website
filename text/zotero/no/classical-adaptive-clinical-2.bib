	abstract = {Excerpt: "This book introduces pharmaceutical statisticians, scientists, researchers, and others to {ExpDesign} Studio software for classical and adaptive designs of clinical trials. It includes the Professional Version 5.0 of {ExpDesign} Studio software that frees pharmaceutical professionals to focus on drug development and related challenges while the software handles the essential calculations and computations. After a hands-on introduction to the software and an overview of clinical trial designs encompassing numerous variations, Classical and Adaptive Clinical Trial Designs Using {ExpDesign} Studio: * Covers both classical and adaptive clinical trial designs, monitoring, and analyses * Explains various classical and adaptive designs including groupsequential, sample-size reestimation, dropping-loser, biomarker-adaptive, and response-adaptive randomization designs * Includes instructions for over 100 design methods that have been implemented in {ExpDesign} Studio and step-by-step demos as well as real-world examples * Emphasizes applications, yet covers key mathematical formulations * Introduces readers to additional toolkits in {ExpDesign} Studio that help in designing, monitoring, and analyzing trials, such as the adaptive monitor, graphical calculator, the probability calculator, the confidence interval calculator, and more * Presents comprehensive technique notes for sample-size calculation methods, grouped by the number of arms, the trial endpoint, and the analysis basis Written with practitioners in mind, this is an ideal self-study guide for not only statisticians, but also scientists, researchers, and professionals in the pharmaceutical industry, contract research organizations ({CROs}), and regulatory bodies. It's also a go-to reference for biostatisticians, pharmacokinetic specialists, and principal investigators involved in clinical trials."},
