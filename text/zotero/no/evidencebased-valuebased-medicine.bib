	abstract = {Excerpt: "Medical research and practice is currently evolving from evidence-based medicine to an even higher quality of patient care: value based medicine. Value-based medicine, which measures the patient-perceived value and integrates relevant costs provided by healthcare interventions, allows a more accurate measure of the overall worth of interventions to a patient and other stakeholders.

Evidence-Based to Value-Based Medicine explains this evolution and explains the uses and practice of value-based medicine in today's healthcare environment. Through detailed explanations about how to integrate value-based medicine and macroeconomic issues, this resource will teach practitioners how to deliver a higher quality of clinical care and to measure and demonstrate the value of their interventions to patients, policymakers, and payers. Also included are innovative input variable methodologies, a critical appraisal of health-related quality-of-life instruments, and an overview of healthcare economics. "},
