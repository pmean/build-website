Most of those who opposed were doctors of naturopathy ({NDs}). Not one opposing letter, however, offered an example of an inaccurate statement made in the article itself. Rather, the arguments were based on logical fallacies, mostly the ad hominem (I was “biased," “hostile,” and “must feel threatened”) and its close relative, the tu quoque (I have no right to criticize naturopathy when regular medicine is so bad, “doesn't have all the answers,” etc.). They were also based on a denial (in the case of {NDs}) or on an ignorance (in the case of several others) of naturopathic literature. There were several common themes; I will address those and make additional comments specific to the letters printed here."},
