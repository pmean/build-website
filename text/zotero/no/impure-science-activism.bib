Inside a large and often floodlit arean with a diffuse and porous perimeter, an eclectic assortment of actors has sought to assert and assess credible knowledge about {AIDS}: biomedical researchers and health care professionals of different stripes; activists, advocacy groups, and people with {AIDS} or {HIV} infection; health educators and social scientists; politicians and public health officials; government agencies and advisory committees; pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies; writers, journalists, and the institutions of the mainstream and alternative media. 'What we know about {IADS}' is the product of this elaborate, often heated, and in some ways quite peculiar complex of interactions."},
