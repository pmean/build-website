	abstract = {Psychologists studying whether and when events occur face unique design and analytic difficulties. The fundamental problem is how to handle censored observations, the people for whom the target event does not occur before data collection ends. The methods of survival analysis overcome these difficulties and allow researchers to describe patterns of occurrence, compare these patterns among groups, and build statistical models of the risk of occurrence over time. A unified description of survival analysis that focuses on 2 topics (study design and data analysis) is presented, showing how psychologists have used the methods during the past decade and identifying new directions for future application. The presentation is based on the authors' own experiences with the methods in modeling employee turnover and examples drawn from research on mental health, addiction, social interaction, and the life course.},
