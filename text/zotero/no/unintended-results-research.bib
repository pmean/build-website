	abstract = {Description: "This letter is a response to an article about the epidemic of HIV/AIDS in Vancouver, British Columbia. The letter writer is critical of the article and claims that research subjects in the study have been 'harmed, stigmatised and quite probably subjected to increased levels of violence'. He goes on to argue that the subjects did not provide informed consent. 'When women gave permission to be tested for HIV they did not anticipate that it would be used to stigmatise them, and presumably when they gave consent for it to be used for research they were not informed of that.'"},
