	abstract = {In recent years, the use of adaptive methods in clinical development based on accrued data has become very popular due to its flexibility in modifying trial procedures and/or statistical procedures of on-going clinical trials. However, it is a concern that the actual patient population after the modifications could deviate from the originally targeted patient population. Major modifications of trial procedures and/or statistical procedures of on-going trials may result in a totally different trial, which is unable to address the scientific/medical questions that the trial intends to answer.},
