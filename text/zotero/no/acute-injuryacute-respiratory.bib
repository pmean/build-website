	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The impact of pre-existing diabetes on the development of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ALI}/{ARDS}) in critically ill patients remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of cohort studies to evaluate the risk of {ALI}/{ARDS} in critically ill patients with and without pre-existing diabetes.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We searched {PubMed} and Embase from the inception to September 2013 for cohort studies assessing the effect of pre-existing diabetes on {ALI}/{ARDS} occurrence. Pooled odds ratio ({OR}) with 95% confidence interval ({CI}) was calculated using random- or fixed-effect models when appropriate.
{RESULTS}: Seven cohort studies with a total of 12,794 participants and 2,937 cases of pre-existing diabetes, and 2,457 cases of {ALI}/{ARDS} were included in the meta-analysis. A fixed-effects model meta-analysis showed that pre-existing diabetes was associated with a reduced risk of {ALI}/{ARDS} ({OR} 0.66; 95% {CI}, 0.55-0.80; p<0.001), with low heterogeneity among the studies (I(2)=18.9%; p=0.286). However, the asymmetric funnel plot and Egger's test (p=0.007) suggested publication bias may exist.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our meta-analysis suggests that pre-existing diabetes was associated with a decreased risk of {ALI}/{ARDS} in critically ill adult patients. However, the result should be interpreted with caution because of the potential bias and confounding in the included studies.},
