The conduct of underpowered randomized controlled trials ({RCT}) has recently been criticized in medical journals. We investigated the current prevalence of underpowered {RCT} in rheumatology.


{METHODS}

We searched to identify randomized, prospective {RCT} assessing clinical efficacy of treatments for adult rheumatic diseases published in English in 2001 and 2002. {RCT} were assessed as positive or negative based on the result of the primary outcome measure. For phase {III} {RCT} with negative results without power analysis, we calculated adequate sample size using beta = 0.20 and alpha = 0.05. We also examined trial quality by assessing the adequacy of reported random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and analysis, and compared the quality of reporting of {RCT} with adequate and inadequate sample size.


{RESULTS}

A total of 228 {RCT} met inclusion criteria; of the 205 phase {III} trials, 119 were positive, 81 were negative. The remaining 5 trials made no statistical comparison between interventions, and did not supply enough information for a result to be calculated. Of the 86 negative or indeterminate {RCT}, 37 reported sample size calculations (all but 4 had adequate power). Of the 49 remaining phase {III} trials that did not report power calculations, we conducted sample size calculations; only 10 were adequately powered. Few of the underpowered {RCT} studied rare rheumatic diseases. Negative {RCT} with inadequate sample size were less likely to describe adequate random sequence generation or allocation concealment than positive {RCT} or negative {RCT} with adequate sample size.


{CONCLUSION}

The conduct of underpowered trials is not an infrequent occurrence in rheumatology, with only 50\% of negative or indeterminate phase {III} rheumatology {RCT} in 2001-2002 having adequate sample size.},
