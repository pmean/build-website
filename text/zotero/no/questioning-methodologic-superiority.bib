	abstract = {A resilient issue in research ethics is whether and when a placebo-controlled trial ({PCT}) is justified if it deprives research subjects of a recognized treatment. The clinicians' moral duty to provide the best available care seems to require the use of 'active' controlled trials ({ACTs}) that use an established treatment as a control whenever such a therapy is available. In another regard, {ACTs} are supposedly methodologically inferior to {PCTs}. Hence, the moral duty of the clinical researcher to use the best methods will favor {PCTs}. In this target article, I analyze the three reasons for believing that {ACTs} are inferior to {PCTs} namely: 1) {ACTs} lack 'assay sensitivity'; 2) {ACTs} do not measure absolute effect size; and 3) {ACTs} require more participants; and I contend that none are acceptable. Consequently the tension between clinical and research ethics dissolves: the moral duty of the clinician to avoid {PCTs} is unopposed by methodological considerations.},
