To investigate the prevalence of underpowered randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology ({ASCO}) annual meetings.


{METHODS}

We surveyed all two-arm phase {III} {RCTs} presented at {ASCO} annual meetings from 1995 to 2003 for which negative results were obtained. Post hoc calculations were performed using a power of 80% and an alpha level of .05 (two sided) to determine sample sizes required to detect small, medium, and large effect sizes. For studies reporting a proportion or time-to-event as primary end point, effect size was expressed as an odds ratio ({OR}) or hazard ratio ({HR}), respectively, with a small effect size defined as {OR}/{HR} >or= 1.3, medium effect size defined as {OR}/{HR} >or= 1.5, and large effect size defined as {OR}/{HR} >or= 2.0. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with lack of statistical power.


{RESULTS}

Of 423 negative {RCTs} for which post hoc sample size calculations could be performed, 45 (10.6%), 138 (32.6%), and 233 (55.1%) had adequate sample size to detect small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively. Only 35 negative {RCTs} (7.1%) reported a reason for inadequate sample size. In a multivariable model, studies that were presented at oral sessions (P = .0038), multicenter studies supported by a cooperative group (P < .0001), and studies with time to event as primary outcome (P < .0001) were more likely to have adequate sample size.


{CONCLUSION}

More than half of negative {RCTs} presented at {ASCO} annual meetings do not have an adequate sample to detect a medium-size treatment effect.},
