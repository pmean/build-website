This is a nice article explaining why using a rainbow
(red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet) is a bad idea. The colors
produce an artefactual banding pattern, they do not follow a consistent
trend from light to dark, they cause trouble for people with color
blindness, and they translate poorly to black-and-white reproductions.
The article also shows some nice alternatives. Thanks to \@EarlGlynn for
sharing this.
