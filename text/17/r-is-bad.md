<div class="notes">

Arguing about R versus SAS often takes on a religious fervor, so I
normally hesitate to recommend articles that trash one package or the
other. But this one raises an interesting point which makes it worth
reading. Note that "recommended" does not mean that I endorse these
conclusions. But rather than bias you with my perception of the issue,
just read this on your own.
