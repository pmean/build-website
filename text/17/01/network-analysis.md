These are the slides for a very nice webinar presented by Eiko Fried.
Dr. Fried provided a wealth of resources during his webinar (some of
these are behind pay walls).

He offered examples of network analysis in the study of [bereavement and
depression](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fabn0000028)
and of [post-traumatic stress
disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27936411). He also
provided tutorial papers on [network models with binary
data](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05918) and [regularized
partial correlation networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01367)., as
well as a nice general [overview of network models in mental
health](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00127-016-1319-z).
He shared a blog posting on [the relationship between a latent variable
model and a network
model](http://psych-networks.com/meaning-model-equivalence-network-models-latent-variables-theoretical-space/)
and a facebook page on [psychological
dynamics](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PsychologicalDynamics/). He
also showed analyses from several R packages,
[qgraph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qgraph/index.html),
[IsingFit](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/IsingFit/index.html),
and
[bootnet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bootnet/index.html).
I'm putting those links here so I don't lose track of them when I
revisit this stuff six months from now.
