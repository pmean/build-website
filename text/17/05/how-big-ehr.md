I have been working part-time on a project for the Great Plains
Collaborative (GPC) under the direction of Russ Waitman and the gentle
guidance of Dan Connolly, both at Kansas University Medical Center. I
hoping to submit a paper soon on the work I've done, but if you are
curious about the size and scope of the electronic health records that
I've been slinging around, this [blog
entry](https://informatics.kumc.edu/work/blog/heron-michigan-update)
might help.

<!---More--->

The i2b2 repository I am working with is called Heron, and each monthly
update of Heron is named after a body of water in the seven states
represented in the GPC. The Lake Michigan version of Heron has over 2
billion observations. It includes information from the electronic health
record (EHR) system used at Kansas University Hospital (Epic) in areas
like alerts, allergy reports, demographics, diagnoses, medical history,
lab results, medications and procedures. Heron also has linked patient
records in the EHR to patient records in the [SEER Cancer
Registry](https://seer.cancer.gov/registries/) and the [National
Cardiovascular Data Registry](https://cvquality.acc.org/NCDR-Home.aspx).
You can find documentation about the GPC at the [PCORI
website](http://www.pcori.org/research-results/2013/greater-plains-collaborative-gpc),
in a [JAMIA
article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4078294/), or at
the [GPC website itself](http://www.gpcnetwork.org/).
