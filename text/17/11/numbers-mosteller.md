This is a chapter in a classic book, Medical Uses of Statistics. The
writer of this particular chapter was a giant in Statistics, Frederick
Mosteller. This chapter talks about some of the style issues associated
with the data that you would normally present in your results section of
your research paper. The advice is a bit dated, perhaps, but still well
worth reading.
