Networking is important, and until recently I have failed to build
bridges with some of the very smart people working at the University of
Kansas in Lawrence. But I will be giving a colloquium talk to a group
([Center for Research Methods and Data Analysis](http://crmda.ku.edu/))
at KU in January.It may be for a different, but closely related group,
but it doesn't matter. It's an excuse to get out of the office and meet
people. Here's the tentative title and abstract for my talk and a brief
review of some other talks I'll be giving.

Title: Setting up your independent consulting practice.

Abstract: If you wish to become an independent statistical consultant,
you will find that the work is challenging, but also rewarding. In this
talk, I will contrast working as an independent consultant to working
within a large organization. I will then review the issues that you face
withÂ an independent consulting practice: business models, billing,
contracts, taxes, and most importantly, how to find clients.

In December, I'll be talking to the Kansas City R Users Group about
Stan, a program to run Bayesian data analyses. I'll also talk about Stan
at the February meeting of the KUMC Biostatistics Journal Club.

The date is not yet official, but I'll also be giving a talk in February
about how to write the methods section of a research grant for the UMKC
Writing Studio.

I'll be giving a webinar for the Analysis Factor in February or March
about transformations, another webinar later that spring about
equivalence and non-inferiority tests, and an eight week web course on
survival analysis.
