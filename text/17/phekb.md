Some of the work I am doing right now could be characterized as
discovering phenotypes from electronic health records. So when one of my
co-workers mentioned this database, I thought "Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!"
This is a list of validated algorithms for various systems, and
typically refers to a peer-reviewed publication. So once I get my stuff
published, I'm heading here next.
