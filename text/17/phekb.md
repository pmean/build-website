Some of the work I am doing right now could be characterized as discovering phenotypes from electronic health records. So when one of my co-workers mentioned this database, I thought "Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!" This is a list of validated algorithms for various systems, and typically refers to a peer-reviewed publication. So once I get my stuff published, I'm heading here next. There is a [publication][kir2] that provides more details.
