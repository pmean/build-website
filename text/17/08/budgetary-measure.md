Like a lot of public universities, UMKC is having a lot of financial
difficulty. They are asking for advice from faculty members on how to
address this budget shortfall. Not being the bashful type, I suggested
that we stop paying commercial software vendors and commercial journal
publishers and rely instead on open source. Here's the details of my
letter.

<!---More--->

I appreciate the effort to talk openly about the budget shortfall (such
as the email from Barbara Bichelmeyer on August 30). In that email, she
asked that suggestions on budget savings be sent to this email address.
I have two suggestions.

1\. Cancel all computer software contracts and replace these software
products with equivalent open source products. I do not know how much we
spend at UMKC on software, but you should find out, as I suspect it may
be substantial. In particular, I am aware that the prices for
statistical software, meaning SAS and SPSS, run very high. There is an
excellent open source program, R, that has all the features of SAS and
SPSS, but which would cost the university nothing. There would be some
expenses transitioning from SAS and SPSS to R, but these transition
costs would be more than offset by the amount of money that we would no
longer need to pay to those software companies. We also pay a
substantial amount of money to Microsoft, and while I am less familiar
with the software alternatives to Windows and Office, I suspect that we
could get all of the features of that software without having to pay for
them. Again, there would be transition costs associated with this, but
it should still lead to substantial net savings.

2\. Cancel all our journal subscriptions and rely on open source journals
instead. At the same time, encourage researchers to submit papers only
to open source journals and to referee papers only for open source
journals. There is substantial evidence that "for profit" journals have
exploited their near monopoly status to increase prices beyond what is
needed to publish their journals. They have transitioned from paper to
electronic versions which greatly reduces publication costs, and which
have gotten substantial support from academic institutions like ours
through free peer-review and editorial services. A transition to open
source journals would have costs associated with it, but the net savings
should still be substantial.

These are radical suggestions, but there is substantial evidence that
our students will be relying more on open source products and less on
proprietary products in the future. Why should we keep throwing money
away for software and journals that are becoming less and less relevant?

If there is interest in pursuing either of these options, I would be
glad to provide whatever assistance I can.
