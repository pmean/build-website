I heard about a new series of conferences for learning about R. I have
not attended any of them, but they look interesting.

<!---More--->

The conference series is called EARL, which stands for "Enterprise
Applications of the R Language". The [conference
website](https://earlconf.com/) gives details of a July 2017 meeting in
San Francisco, and upcoming conferences in September 2017 in London, and
November 2017 in Boston.

Another series of conferences that look interesting are the UserR
conferences. The next one is in Brisbane, Australia, July 10-13, 2018.
The R-project website has a [page listing past and future UserR
conferences](https://www.r-project.org/conferences.html).
