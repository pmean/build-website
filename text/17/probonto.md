If you work with probability distributions a lot, you find there are
mutliple parameterizations (e.g., the two different forms of the
exponential distribution), as well as interesting relationships (the
geometric distribution is a discrete version of the exponential
distribution). I have found Wikipedia to be a nice guide for some of
this, but the coverage is uneven in quality. One of the Wikipedia links
mentioned a new website, ProbOnto, that offers a systematic and
standardized attempt to catalog every important probability distribution
and the relationships among these distributions.
