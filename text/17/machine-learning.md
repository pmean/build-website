![Machine Learning cartoon](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/machine_learning.png)

This xkcd cartoon by Scott Munro is open source, so I can hotlink the
image directly. But if you go to the source, <https://xkcd.com/1838/>,
be sure to hover over the image for a second punch line.

The cartoon reads:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is your machine learning system?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yup! You pour the data into this big pile of linear algebra, then collect the answers on the other side.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the answers are wrong?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just stir the pile until they start looking right.

When you hover over the image, you get this caption:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pile gets soaked with data and starts to get mushy over time, so it's technically recurrent.
