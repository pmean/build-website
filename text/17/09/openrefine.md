I have not had a chance to use this, but it comes [highly
recommended](../good-enough/index.html). OpenRefine is a program that
uses a graphical user interface to clean up messy data, but it saves all
the clean up steps to insure that your work is well documented and
reproducible. I listed Martin Magdinier as the "author" in the citation
below because he has posted most of the blog entries about OpenRefine,
but there are [many contributors](http://openrefine.org/community.html)
to this package and website.
