While researchers often use data from health insurance systems to
conduct observational studies, the authors of this research paper point
out that you can also conduct randomized trials as well. You can
randomly assign different levels of insurance coverage and then get
claims data to evaluate how much difference there is, if any, in the
levels of coverage. This approach is attractive because you do not need
a lot of resources, and you can very quickly get a very large sample
size. Since insurance data is collected for administrative needs rather
than research needs, you have to contend with inaccurate or incomplete
data, potentially causing loss of statistical efficiency or producing
biased results. The authors offer some interesting examples of actual
studies, propose new potential studies, and offer general guidance on
how to conduct a randomized trial from health insurance
systems.
