I heard about a new series of conferences for learning about R. I have not attended any of them, but they look interesting.

<!---More--->

The conference series is called EARL, which stands for "Enterprise Applications of the R Language". The [conference website][ear1] gives details of a July 2017 meeting in San Francisco, and upcoming conferences in September 2017 in London, and November 2017 in Boston.

Another series of conferences that look interesting are the UserR conferences. The next one is in Brisbane, Australia, July 10-13, 2018. The R-project website has a [page listing past and future UserR conferences][rpr1].

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [blog][sim2].
