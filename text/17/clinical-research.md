This is a website associated with a very nice book on the pragmatic
aspects of running a clinical trial. I came across this site because I
was looking for a simple example of a letter to doctors asking them to
help recruit patients for a clinical trial. This was in an appendix
along with other nice examples of things like case report forms, serious
adverse event forms, HIPAA consent template, etc. You can download a
free PDF version of this book or you can buy a paper copy.
