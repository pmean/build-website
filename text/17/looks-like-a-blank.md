I was having trouble with trailing blanks in an R program. There were
some strings that looked like " Y" and "Y " and it's easy enough to fix
this, but one of the "Y " values was not converting properly. The second
character wasn't a blank, but it looked like it. Here's what I had to
do.

<!---More--->

First, there are several ways to remove leading and trailing blanks. I
used the commands

```{}
mv1[, i] %<>% sub("^ +", "", .)
mv1[, i] %<>% sub(" +$", "", .)
```

which might not be the best, but it worked for every instance of " Y"
and "Y " except one instance of "Y ". It took forever to find the value,
because searching on "Y " obviously didn't work. I finally said, find
anything that is not what I thought all the possible values might be. It
was row 168. When you printed the value,

```{}
> mv1[168, 14]
[1] "Y "
```

it looked fine. So I figured I had to look at the underlying ascii
codes. There's a way to do this in R, the charToRaw function.

```{}
> charToRaw(mv1[168, i])
[1] 59 a0
```

I knew that the code for blank in ascii is 32, so something is
definitely up here. You can find out quickly on the web at a0 is a
non-breaking space. How that got into the data set is a mystery to me.
Now, how do you fix it? There is a rawToChar function, but if you just
say

```{}
rawToChar(a0)
```

it won't work. There's an as.raw function, but it doesn't take
hexadecimal. So you have to convert a0 to 160 and then it works. There's
also an intToUtf8 function and probably other ways as well.
