The authors looked at all systematic reviews (excluding methodological
reviews) published in a few key journals as well as a random sample of
Cochrane reviews to see how often the authors tried to search for
unpublised data. The answer is not often enough (64% or 130/203). The
article also describes the success rate in getting unpublished data when
the attempt was made (89% or 116/130) and how often authors found
evidence of publication bias when they did such an assessment (40% or
27/68). Although some people have argued that it is not that important
to search for unpublised data, this is still a big concern. A closely
related article is [Searching for unpublished data for Cochrane reviews:
cross sectional
study](http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f2231).
