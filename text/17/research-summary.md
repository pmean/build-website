I might be giving a very brief (5 minute) overview of my research for
students in the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics. Here
are some details of that work, with links if anyone wants to dig
deeper.

<!---More--->

I am interested in research about the research process, and one very
simple thing that would be easy to replicate would be an audit that I
made of IRB approvals at Childrens Mercy Hospital over a five year
period. I found that more than half of the studies failed to recruit the
number of patients that they promised to get. I never got this research
published, but it would be pretty easy to do so. I do have a [brief
summary](http://www.pmean.com/08/SlippedDeadlines.html) on my website.

A big reason for the shortfall on sample size is that it takes longer to
get patients than you might think. I have built some Bayesian models
that can forecast how long it might take to accrue the required number
of patients. Details are available on [my
website](http://www.pmean.com/category/AccrualProblems.html) and [my
blog](../tag/accrual/index.html).

I am working on mining the electronic health record at KUMC and while
that research is proprietary, it would not be too hard to replicate the
work on Health Facts. Here is an [early
account](../breast-cancer-study/index.html) of what I have been working
on, and I hope to have a publication soon based on this work.

There are a couple of other studies that I ran using the NHAMCS database
of CDC that could very easily be replicated on Health Facts. One is a
look at the [care of children with
asthma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694945) who report to the
Emergency Room and are sometimes given bad therapies or not given good
therapies.

Another is the [10 most common Dermatology
diagnoses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27317526) that a
pediatrician is likely to see. The link in Pubmed is not very helpful
because there is no abstract and the article is behind a paywall, but I
can send more details if you are interested.

I am also interested in developing case studies in research ethics. Here
is [an example](http://pmean.com/cases/Tgn1412Popwerpoint.pdf).
