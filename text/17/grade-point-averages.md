In applying for various jobs, one of them wanted to know my grade point
averages from school. That was over 35 years ago, but okay. I had to
calculate them by hand and I don't think I've ever known what they are
other than they weren't a 4.0.

I should warn you that back then, if I hated a class, I skipped a lot
and didn't turn in the homework. I know, I know, it was a bad attitude.
But I was just a kid and didn't know any better. So a few C grades here
and then pulled my average down.I got a lecture from my adviser my first
year in graduate school that maybe I should spend a year digging ditches
by the highway to give me a better perspective on life. I didn't take
him up on his offer, and my grades only improved a tiny bit. I did get
in trouble on my qualifying exams, passing them, but not without another
lecture. That's another story.

If they ask for my IQ, I don't know it. I did work with one guy who told
me that I was one of the two smartest people that he knew. And he worked
with a lot of smart people. But that's a limited sample size.

I think these numbers have very limited usefulness. But if you are
curious, here they are.

Undergraduate: 3.1

Masters: 3.4

PhD: 3.4
