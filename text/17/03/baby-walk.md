I submitted a [cute probability
problem](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-baby-walk-away-will-the-troll-kill-the-dwarves/)
to the Riddler section of [Nate Silver's Five Thirty Eight web
site](https://fivethirtyeight.com/).Â  Here's a cut-and-paste of the
problem.

From Steve Simon, an adorable living-room puzzle:

Your baby is learning to walk. The baby begins by holding onto a couch.
Whenever she is next to the couch, there is a 25 percent chance that she
will take a step forward and a 75 percent chance that she will stay
clutching the couch. If the baby is one or more steps away from the
couch, there's a 25 percent chance that she will take a step forward, a
25 percent chance she'll stay in place and a 50 percent chance she'll
take one step back toward the couch.

In the long run, what percent of the time does the baby choose to clutch
the couch?
