Networking is important, and until recently I have failed to build bridges with some of the very smart people working at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. But I will be giving a colloquium talk to a group ([Center for Research Methods and Data Analysis][crmd1]) at KU in January. It may be for a different, but closely related group, but it doesn't matter. It's an excuse to get out of the office and meet people. Here's the tentative title and abstract for my talk and a brief review of some other talks I'll be giving.

Title: Setting up your independent consulting practice.

Abstract: If you wish to become an independent statistical consultant, you will find that the work is challenging, but also rewarding. In this talk, I will contrast working as an independent consultant to working within a large organization. I will then review the issues that you face with�an independent consulting practice: business models, billing, contracts, taxes, and most importantly, how to find clients.

In December, I'll be talking to the Kansas City R Users Group about Stan, a program to run Bayesian data analyses. I'll also talk about Stan at the February meeting of the KUMC Biostatistics Journal Club.

The date is not yet official, but I'll also be giving a talk in February about how to write the methods section of a research grant for the UMKC Writing Studio.

I'll be giving a webinar for the Analysis Factor in February or March about transformations, another webinar later that spring about equivalence and non-inferiority tests, and an eight week web course on survival analysis.
