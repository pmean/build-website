<div class="notes">

I normally don't recommend other people's tweets, but these two from Siobhan Tompson were too funny to pass up.

Here are the texts of the two tweets:

The numbers for the Science March seem high but we won't know until we compare it to the numbers at the placebo march that is also happening.

I honestly feel bad for the people on the Placebo March that thought they were at the Science March but double blind testing is important.
