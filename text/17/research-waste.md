This is the first in a series of articles on reducing waste in research.
It focuses on funding agencies and recommends that funders should
support more work on making research replicable, be more transparent on
how they set priorities, make sure that research proposals are justified
through a systematic review of previous research, and encourage greater
openness of research in progress to encourage collagoration. Other
articles in this series cover [research design, conduct, and
analysis](http://www.testingtreatments.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2-Ioannidis-et-al.-Paper-2.pdf),
[regulation and
management](http://www.testingtreatments.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3-Salman-et-al-Paper-3.pdf),
[inaccessible
research](http://www.testingtreatments.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/4-Chan-et-al.-Paper-4.pdf),
and [incomplete reports of
research](http://www.testingtreatments.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-Glasziou-et-al.-Paper-5.pdf).
