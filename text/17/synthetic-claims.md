The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provides researchers
with access to Medicare claims data, which is a wonderful resources. But
you have to sign a restrictive agreement before they will give you this
data and you have to pay a non-trivial amount of money to get the data.
Fair enough, because CMS has to guarantee patient confidentiality among
other things. But what if you want to "play" with the data before taking
the plunge? Thankfully, CMS has provided to the general public a
synthetic (read fake) data set that has the same data structure. This
allows you to prototype your programs on the synthetic data and then
transition easily to the real data.
