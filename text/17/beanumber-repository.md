This is the github repository of Ben Baumer. He is one of the co-authors of "Modern Data Science with R" and the data and code from that book is available here. He also provides code and data for OpenWAR an open source method for calculating a baseball statistic Wins Above Replacement. Finally there is an R library for extracting, transforming and loading "medium" sized datasets into SQL. Medium here means multi-gigabyte sized files. Related to this are a couple of "medium" sized data sets from the Internet Movie Database and from the NYC CitiBike dataset.
