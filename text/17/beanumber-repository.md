This is the github repository of Ben Baumer. He is one of the co-authors
of "Modern Data Science with R" and the data and code from that book is
available here. He also provides code and data for OpenWAR
- an open
source method for calculating a baseball statistic
- Wins Above
Replacement. Finally
- there is an R library for extracting,
transforming
- and loading "medium" sized datasets into SQL. Medium here
means multi-gigabyte sized files. Related to this are a couple of
"medium" sized data sets from the Internet Movie Database and from the
NYC CitiBike dataset.
