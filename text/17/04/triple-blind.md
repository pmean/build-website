This paper advocates something I would call a triple blind, keeping the
doctor, the patient, and the statistician who analyzes the data in the
dark as to which treatment group is which. This avoids problems where
the people analyzing the data will either consciously or subconsciously
manipulate the data to get a preferred result. Interesting idea, though
it represents an awful amount of work to pull it off.
