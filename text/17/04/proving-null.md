I'm attending a great short course on non-inferiority trials and the
speaker provided a key reference of historical interest. This reference
is the one that got the Statistics community interested in the concept
of non-inferiority. The full text is behind a paywall, but you can look
at the abstract. A footnote is a paper, [Dunnett and Gent
1977](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/588654), (also trapped behind
a paywall) addressed this problem earlier.
