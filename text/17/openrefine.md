I have not had a chance to use this, but it comes [highly recommended][sim3]. OpenRefine is a program that uses a graphical user interface to clean up messy data, but it saves all the clean up steps to insure that your work is well documented and reproducible. I listed Martin Magdinier as the "author" in the citation below because he has posted most of the blog entries about OpenRefine, but there are [many contributors][magd2] to this package and website.
