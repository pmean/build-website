<div class="notes">

Let me introduce myself. I am Steve Simon. I got a PhD in Statistics almost 40 years ago from the University of Iowa. The world has changed a lot since then, but I have tried to keep up. Today, if you want to sound trendy, you are a "data scientist". I teach in the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics at UMKC. I have had previous jobs at Children's mercy Hospital, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I'm also a part-time statistical consultant. I have a sole proprietorship, P.Mean Consulting. That's short for Professor Mean. For people who don't get the joke, I point out that Professor Mean is not just your average Professor. Related to this talk, I should point out that I am obsessed with computers.

### Obsessed with computers since 1972

<div class="notes">

Think about your high school algebra class.

1. Do you remember any important formulas from that class?

2. Did you hate, hate, hate high school algebra?

3. Did you love high school algebra?

Big question: Will you use high school algebra in your future?

Big question: What impact does the current generation's immersion of computing have on society?

### Are Statisticians Gods?

I'm helping someone who wants an alternative statistical analysis to the one used by the principal investigator. I'm happy to help and will offer advice about why my approach may be better, but I was warned that the PI considers the analysis chosen to be ordained by the **"Statistical Gods"** at her place of work.

<div class="notes">

True story. I was asked to review a report from a federal agency, but was warned that negative comments, even if accurate, might not be well received because the agency's work was ordained by their Statistic Gods. At first, I thought this was amusing. If I could get the title of "Statistical God", I could double my hourly consulting rate. But deep down this story really bothered me. It implies that Statistical skills are supernatural, and only available to a select few special people. I learned Statistics through hard work, and you can learn Statistics through hard work also. Some people will learn it faster than others because they have good aptitudes in mathematics and programming. But there is nothing other than time to stop you.
