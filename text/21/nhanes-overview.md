The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a large scale survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It uses a complex sampling scheme to insure that the results are representative of the population of the United States, excluding institutionalized persons. It is an unusal survey because it is combined with a physical exam, a dietary evaluation and a wide range of laboratory measurements from blood and urine samples. On this web page, I want to provide a not-too-technical overview of how CDC collects data for this survey as well as their recommendations on how to analyze it.

The CDC provides a [nice historical summary][cdc01] of NHANES. It started out as a series of surveys in the 1960s. the National Health Examination Survey. In 1971, the survey added information about nutrition and was re-labeled the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The series of surveys were labelled NHANES I (1971 to 1975), NHANES II (1976 to 1980), NHANES III (1988 to 1994), and continuous NHANES (1999 to present). A closely related survey Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) focussed on three major Hispanic groups (Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, and Puerto Ricans) and was conducted from 1982 to 1984. While various features of the sample and the data collected varied from one series to the next, the CDC made a conscious effort to maintain a broad similarity across these series to allow researchers to evaluate trends and changes over a multi-year period.

Although I will use NHANES as a generic description of all of the series of survey described above, the following descriptions will apply only to continuous NHANES.
