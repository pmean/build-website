UMKC has yearly awards that it hands out to faculty including a [faculty researcher award][fac1]. The awards allow for self-nomination, so I thought "Why not?"

Here is a review of the criteria for the award and an early draft of my application. Wish me luck.

<!--more-->

The award is to recognize "clinical and/or bench research." As a statistician, my work does not fall neatly into either category. I can probably claim both, though more of my work has been on the clinical end.

I need to show "significant contributions to the medical research" and this includes publications, presentations, and grants. I have a pretty good record in all of these areas, as I show below.

I also need to show "a sustained record of collaborating and mentoring learners and faculty in research." It is a bit harder to quantify this. I can get some letters of support that might help here.

Grant funding is very important. I "must have received grant funding as a Principal Investigator or Co-Principal Investigator" or I must have "consistently contributed as Co-Investigator on funded research." I have one grant where I am the principal investigator and can point to seven more what I am a co-investigator or consultant.

I need to prepare a nomination letter. This letter must document "how the individual’s clinical or bench research has impacted UMKC." It asks for specific outcome measures.

The first is the "number of peer-reviewed PMID publications and journal name(s) in the past 5 years." If it has to be in Pubmed and be peer-reviewed, then I have 9. If you are more inclusive, I have 13.

The second is the "number of presentations (invited and peer reviewed) at regional, national, and international academic meetings in the past 5 years." In my career of close to 40 years, I have never had a peer-reviewed presentation. This is not the norm in the world of Statistics. It is very difficult to count the number of invited presentations, as there is a fuzzy boundary between invited and contributed presentations. If you count invited presentations, I have one that is definitely invited, and two or three that could probably be counted as invited.

The third is the "number and type of grants (and if these grants are UMKC SOM), amount of funding, and role in each project in past 5 years." Amount of funding is problematic as many of these grants are massive multi-site initiatives and my role, while not insubstantial, does not account for more than a small fraction of the effort.

The fourth is the "number of learners and faculty that nominee has collaborated and mentored in research in the last 5 years, including the number of learners and faculty that have obtained peer-reviewed PMID publications and presentations (academic meetings at regional, national, and international meetings) in the past 5 years" This is absolutely impossible to quantify. I'll include a couple of collaborators in the letters of reference.

The fifth is any "research innovations, patents, or other contributions to research in past 5 years." I don't have any patents, per see, and any "innovations" or "other contributions" would be difficult to specify.

I need to submit

+ a nomination letter (see below for an early draft),
+ three letters of support, and
+ a recent CV.

### Early draft of my nomination letter.

I wish to submit this self-nomination for the Faculty Researcher Award. I am enclosing this nomination letter, three letters of support, and a current CV.

As a consulting statistician, my research efforts are largely in support of other researchers. In the past five years, I do have one grant where I am the principal investigator, but on the remaining grants, I am tpyically making a small but important role inplay a smaller role, typically supported at 10% effor or less. Likewise, in most of my publications, I am a co-author rather than the lead author. I don't mind playing second fiddle in these settings; my best work is often a small piece of a larger project.

My job, I tell people, is to make smart people smarter. I assist with details like data management, sample size justification, and documentation of research methods. These make no direct contribution to the practice of medicine, but are still vital components of any grant or publication. As such, my efforts are largely behind the scenes.

My greatest contribution to enhance the research reputation of the UMKC School of Medicine has been through research grants. Since I started work at UMKC in 2009, I have received formal support on 13 research grants (7 in the past five years, see the list below). This does not include, however, the large number of grants that I have provided informal assistance on. In particular, I have helped write many Sarah Morrison research awards as part of my work for the Research and Statistical Consult Service.

I have given talks on grant writing both locally and at national conferences. These talks focus on aspects of the grant that are not difficult, such as creating a data sharing plan or setting up a data safety monitoring board. Nevertheless, these details are the ones that most grant writers feel the greatest insecurity and uncertainty about. Providing rigorous documentation of the non-medical aspects of a research study makes these grants more competitive. It's all part of my effort to make smart people smarter.

I have an extensive publication record, with 31 publications since I started work at UMKC (14 in the past five years). Some of this represents my own effort. Dr. Shui Ye invited me to write a chapter on the R programming language in his book, Big Data Analysis for Bioinformatics, published in 2015. I also contributed two articles to The Encyclopedia of Big Data, published in 2018. These articles describe the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the two most important government agencies for providing big data that our researchers use.

Just as with grants, however, my best work is on those publications where I am not the lead author. I co-authored three publications (two in the past five years) from the research team that used a network of African-American churches to deliver health care interventions to underserved communities in Kansas City. Two more publications (one in the past five years) was with a quality improvement effort team at Children's Mercy Hospital and Boston Children's Hospital that examined the quality of echocardiograms at both institutions. In both cases, the medical work was done by others, but I played a major role in the documentation of methods and reporting of results.

My role in research presentations is difficult to quantify. I stopped tracking most presentations over 20 years ago, because there were too many of them and it was impossible to indepdently verify them.

I only track presentations where I am the first author. I have 42 first author presentations at regional, national, or international conferences since I started work at UMKC (23 in the past five years). None of these presentations were peer-reviewed, as that is not the norm in the field of Statistics. 

My most popular presentations are short courses. I have been invited to give short courses to the American Society of Andrology, the American Statistical Association, the Medical Librarians Association, and the Midwest Society for Pediatric Research. These organizations all asked me back repeatedly because my short courses were so well received.

#### 8 grants funded from July 2016 through June 2021.

Note: I have not included the total grant awards for any of these grants, which total over $30 million dollars. While I have a substantial role in all of these grants, it would be folly to suggest that that I am responsible for anywhere close to the total amount of support on any of these grants. Most of the success of these grants is due to the hard work of others. This list also does not include grants submitted but not funded.

1. Healthy Eastside KC (Jackson County Legislature, Principal Investigator: Jannette Berkley-Patton). This is a community-based partnership and project to address vaccine hesitancy and health inequities in portions of Jackson County identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as having exceedingly high socially vulnerable index scores. I am funded at 10% effort from June 2021 through November 2021.

2. Lead Impact Study--Kansas City (HHTS20000276, Housing and Urban Development, Principal Investigator: Steve Simon). We propose a data collection effort to show that lead safe interventions can be targeted more effectively and that they can inform decisions about the choices among intervention strategies. Our first aim is to quantify the extent to which remediations to make housing lead safe by HUD standards lead to fewer lead poisoned children among those who move in. Our second aim is to develop an exterior housing-based risk index to cost effectively target homes with higher interior lead dust levels. I am funded at 10% effort from January 2021 through December 2024.

3. COVID-19 Testing and Linkage to Care with African-American Church and Health Agency Partners (DK124664-01S1, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Principal Investigator: Jannette Berkley-Patton). The primary aim of this study is to fully test a culturally/religiously-tailored, church-based COVID19 testing and linkage to care (LTC) intervention condition against a non- tailored intervention condition on COVID19 testing rates at 6 months with adult AA church members and the community members they serve. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior and Socioecological Model, our community- engaged approach includes trained church leaders delivering a culturally, church-appropriate COVID19 Toolkit. Examination of LTC use and contact tracing approval will aid in understanding intervention impact on COVID19 testing by addressing participant essential needs. Potential mediators/moderators related to receipt of COVID-19 testing will be evaluated, and a process evaluation to determine implementation facilitators, barriers, and fidelity related to increasing COVID19 testing rates. I am funded at 10% effort during calendar year 2021 and 5% effort during calendar year 2022.

4. Development of a telehealth obesity intervention for patients with MS. (Multiple Sclerosis Society, Principal Investigator: Jared Bruce) A cross-disciplinary research team is testing the effectiveness of an MS-specific weigh loss/healthy living program delivered by phone, since obesity can profoundly worsen MS severity. I am funded at 2% effort starting in October 2019, increasing to 5% effort from October 2023 through September 2024.

5. Frontiers: University of Kansas Clinical and Translational Science Institute (NIH 5UL1TR002366-04, Principal Investigator: Mario Castro). The Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research has been a catalyst for bringing together translational science investigators and stakeholders across the KC region, and beyond. The vision of Frontiers is to contribute to and lead national efforts to transform the way we do clinical and translational research (CTR), and to ensure research is more rapidly and more efficiently translated to the point of care so that it may contribute to improved health. I am funded at 10% effort starting in September 2017 through June 2021.

6. Preschool Development Grant Birth through Five Initiative (90TP0066-01, Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Principal Investigator: Mike Abel). We present best practices for professionals and programs across Missouri’s early childhood mixed-delivery system. For more than 50 years, early childhood programs that support the growth and development of young children have been shown to have a profound impact on children over their lifespan. The challenge is to identify what elements of a high-quality early childhood program are most associated with positive outcomes for children and families. I was funded at 5% effort from September to December 2020.

7. Greater Plains Collaborative (PCORI HSRP20162063, Principal Investigator: Lemuel Waitman). The Greater Plains Collaborative (GPC) is a new network of 10 leading medical centers in 7 states committed to a shared vision of improving healthcare delivery through ongoing learning, adoption of evidence-based practices, and active research dissemination. Role: Consultant. I billed at an hourly rate from February 2016 to August 2017 when my efforts were switched to "Frontiers: University of Kansas Clinical and Translational Science Institute" described above.
