I attended an interesting webinar on teaching statistical computing skills. The seminar touched on one key paper written in 2010 and a special issue of The Journal of Statistics and Data Science Eduction, published in 2021.

You should start with this article.

+ Deborah Nolan and Duncan Temple Lang (2010) Computing in the Statistics Curricula, The American Statistician, 64:2, 97-107, DOI: 10.1198/tast.2010.09132. This article is behind a paywall, but you can view the abstract in [html format](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1198/tast.2010.09132).

It has a nice Venn diagram that summarizes all of the subtopics that might be covered in a Statistical Computing class.

The special issue has a main article that summarizes the general topics in Statistical Computing and has links in the bibliography to the individual articles.

+ Nicholas J. Horton & Johanna S. Hardin (2021) Integrating computing in the statistics and data science curriculum: Creative structures, novel skills and habits, and ways to teach computational thinking, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, DOI: 10.1080/10691898.2020.1870416. Available in [html format](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2020.1870416) or [pdf format](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10691898.2020.1870416).

I won't include the full bibliographic details of the individual pages, but here are the titles.

+ Implementing version control with Git and GitHub as a learning objective in statistics and data science courses
+ What is happening on Twitter? a framework for student research projects with tweets
+ Teaching statistical concepts and modern data analysis with a computing-integrated learning environment
+ A fresh look at introductory data science
+ Web scraping in the statistics and data science curriculum: Challenges and opportunities
+ Teaching creative and practical data science at scale
+ The data mine: Enabling data science across the curriculum
+ 'Playing the whole game': A data collection and analysis exercise with Google Calendar'
+ Easy-to-use cloud computing for teaching data science
+ Computing in the statistics curricula: A 10-year retrospective

+ Data science in 2020: Computing, curricula, and challenges for the next 10 years
+ Designing data science workshops for data-intensive environmental science research
+ How students use statistical computing in problem solving

In addition to the articles in the special issue, the main article cited some from earlier issues or different journals.
