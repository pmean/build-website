The Joint Statistics Meetings had a great talk on Fairness in Artifical Intelligence (AI). The speaker, Sherrie Rose, documented instances where AI has had a discriminatory effect, the wide ranges of causes of this, and how to fix things. I looked up some of the references and resources that she mentioned in her talk and list them below.

The best place to start is [Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning][fat1], a group that organizes annual conferences on this topic. They have a very nice resource list. Also quite helpful is a working group within the American Statistical Association, the [Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Outreach Group][jed1].

Statistics Canada has a couple of valuable resources:

+ [From Exploring to Building Accurate Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Decision-Making: Think Simple, not Complex][can1]
+ [Responsible use of machine learning at Statistics Canada][can2]

Stories in the news media about this topic include

There are various pre-prints and peer-reviewed publications that offer technical explanations of the problem and propose some solutions.
