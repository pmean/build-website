I've been meaning to update and consolidate my webpages and blog. Here's a list of the things I need to look for as I do the updating.

<!--more-->

1. Systematize the references. No bare html addresses. Put the URLs at the bottom of the page. 

2. Get rid of unnecessary headers, indenting, and bolding. Lean towards plain vanilla text for the most part.

3. Get rid of non-standard characters.

4. Link the old pages to the new ones.
