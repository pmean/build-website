I attended a talk on recent developments in spatial statistics and while most of the talk was over my head, I did not some resources in the introduction that might be helpful for someone like me who is just learning about this approach.

The two books mentioned were

+ Sudipto Banerjee, Bradley P. Carlin, Alan E. Gelfand. Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data, 2nd edition, Chapman and Hall/CRC. The [pulisher's website][ban1] has a nice description.

+ Noel Cressie, Christopher K. Wikle. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data, Wiley. Again, there is a nice description on the [publisher's website][cre1].

Edzer Pebesma, Marius Appel, and Daniel N�st have a nice [blog][peb1], r-spatial, for those interested in learning how to do spatial analysis using R.

Lu Zhang. Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes (NNGP) based models in Stan (2018, Jan), is a nicely worked out [example of spatial analysis][zha1] using the Bayesian package, Stan.
