Doug Bates gave an excellent talk at the 2021 Joint Statistics Meetings about Julia, a new programming language that tries (and to a large extent succeeds) to be both efficient and easy to use. All of his slides are available on his github site. These slides have links to many other resources that you might finding interesting, if you wanted to learn more about Julia.
