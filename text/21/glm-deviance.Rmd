Deviance is a measure computed for generalized linear models that can help you decide between two competing models. It is somewhat analagous to residual sums of squares in linear regression.

```{r setup}
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(broom)))
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2)))
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(magrittr)))
```
