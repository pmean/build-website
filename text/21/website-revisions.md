I've been meaning to update and consolidate my webpages and blog. Here's a list of the things I need to look for as I do the updating.

<!--more-->

1. Edit the appropriate category page. Add 
   <p>These pages are transitioning to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/tags/name/">new website</a>.</p>

2. Link the old pages to the new ones. Add 
   <p>This page has moved to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/post/name/">new website</a>
and remove everything except the header.

3. Systematize the references. No bare html addresses. Put the URLs at the bottom of the page. 

4. Get rid of unnecessary headers, indenting, and bolding. Lean towards plain vanilla text for the most part.

5. Get rid of non-standard characters.

6. Ditch camel case names and underscores. Use dashes instead. Use two or three word names for the most part.

7. Use headers liberally.

8. Get rid of backslashes in front of ", ', etc.

9. Use headers for Dear Professor Mean and Dear Reader

10. List authors in references using first names then the last name rather than the reverse of initials.

11. Move all images and binary files to new-images.
