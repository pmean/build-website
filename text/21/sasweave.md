Russ Lenth has developed a nice system that integrates SAS code and SAS output within a TeX file. This provides a nice way to teach SAS, as you see the SAS code next to the tables and graphs that it produces. Integrating this with TeX makes your output look very nice. If you know how to use TeX to create PDF documents, you will find SASWeave very easy to use. If you are less familiar with TeX, it will take a bit of work, but the example that Dr. Lenth provides is a good starting point.
