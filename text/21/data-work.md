We get a lot of interesting people who show up at the [Kansas City R User Group meetings][kcr1]. Taylor Rodgers is one of them. He is doing a lot of interesting work about how data science teams can work together effectively. The link below is for a book he wrote about this topic. I have not read the book but it does sound very interesting. Also take some time to browse the other resources at his website.
