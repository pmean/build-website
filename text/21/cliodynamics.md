Ben Chugg article defines a term, cliodynamics, as the effort to predict future political and societal events based on past history. He then explains why this process is fatally flawed. A very good and persuasive argument on the limits of Statistics and Data Science. Surprisingly, he does not mention the findings in chaos theory that would further support his argument.
