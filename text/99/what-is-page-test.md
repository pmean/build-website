This page is currently being updated from the earlier version of my website. Sorry that it is not yet fully available.

*Dear Professor Mean, I have recently come across a statistical test
(Page's L test),with which I am unfamiliar. Does anyone either have
information about this test or know where I might find information about
it.*

> Page's test is a **nonparametric test**. It uses the ranks of the
> data, rather than the data itself, so as to avoid any assumptions
> about the underlying distribution of the data.
>
> Page's test is used as an alternative to Friedman's test when the
> **treatments are ordered in a logical sequence** (e.g., no therapy,
> limited therapy, full therapy). Like Friedman's test, it is relevant
> when each subject gets each treatment or when subjects are matched.

**Further reading**

> A nice description of Page's test can be found on pages 284-292 of
> Hollander and Wolfe's book on nonparametric statistics.
>
> **Nonparametric Statistical Methods, Second Edition.** Hollander M,
> Wolfe D. New York NY: John Wiley and Sons, Inc. (1999) ISBN:
> 0-471-19045-4.
