****[StATS]:** Inputting a two-by-two table into
SPSS (created 1999-09-18)**

*Dear Professor Mean, I have the following data in a two by two table:*

::: {align="left"}
  ----------- --------- --------- -----------
       Â        **D+**    **D-**    **Total**
    **F+**     **34**    **23**     **57**
    **F-**     **139**   **119**    **258**
   **Total**   **173**   **142**    **315**
  ----------- --------- --------- -----------
:::

*When I try to enter this data into SPSS, I can\'t get it to compute
risk ratios and confidence intervals. What am I doing wrong? \-- Jinxed
Jason*

Dear Jinxed,

> You have values ranging from F- to D+? I hope this isn\'t data on the
> grades you received in college.
>
> Actually these data are from a paper: Sands et al (1999). F+
> represents presence of a risk factor (in this case, previous
> miscarriage) and F- represents absence of that risk factor. D+
> represents presence of a defect (ventricular septal defect or VSD) and
> D- represents absence of that defect.

> For data like this, you have to re-arrange things and then apply
> weights. The following discussion talks about SPSS, but the general
> method works for most other statistical software.
>
> To re-arrange the data, you need to specify three variables: F, D, and
> COUNT. **F takes the value of 1 for F+ and 0 for F-. D takes the value
> of 1 for D+ and 0 for D-**. The 0-1 coding has some nice mathematical
> properties, but you could use 1 and 2 instead. **For each combination
> of F and D we will record the sample size in COUNT**.

![](../../../web/images/99/table01.gif)

> **Enter the data, and tell SPSS that W represents a weighting
> variable**, and you\'re ready to rock and roll. You do this by
> selecting **Data \| Weight Cases from the SPSS menu.**

![](../../../web/images/99/table02.gif)

> Then select **Analyze \| Descriptive Statistics \| Crosstabs from the
> SPSS menu** to create a two by two table.

![](../../../web/images/99/table03.gif)

> Be sure to click on the **Statistics button** and select the **Risk
> option box** to ask SPSS to compute the risk ratios.

![](../../../web/images/99/table04.gif)

> I also usually find it useful to display the row percentages. To do
> this, click on the **Cells button**.

![](../../../web/images/99/table05.gif)

> In the **Crosstabs: Cell Display dialog box**, select the **Row
> Percentages option box**.
>
> Here\'s what the first part of the output looks like.

![](../../../web/images/99/table06.gif)

> Notice that the rows and columns are reversed in this table. There are
> several ways to change how the table is displayed, but it is showing
> essentially the same information in any order.
>
> Here is what the second part of the output looks like.

![](../../../web/images/99/table07.gif)

> By the way, if you tried to use the crosstabs procedure without
> weighting, you would get exactly one observation in each cell. Pretty
> boring, eh?

**Summary**

> Jinxed Jason can\'t figure out **how to enter data from a two by two
> table into SPSS**. Professor Mean explains that **you need three
> variables to represent a two by two table**. The first variable
> indicates **the specific column** of your table and the second
> variable indicates **the specific row** (or vice versa). The third
> variable indicates **the count or frequency** for each intersection of
> row and column. You do not include the row or column totals in your
> data entry. You can then **select** **Analyze \| Descriptive
> Statistics \| Crosstabs from the SPSS menu** **to analyze the data
> from your two by two table**. You get additional analyses by selecting
> the **Risk and/or Chi-square option boxes**.
