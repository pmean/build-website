This page is currently being updated from the earlier version of my website. Sorry that it is not yet fully available.

*Dear Professor Mean, I found a journal article with a confidence
interval that was asymmetric. For example, the authors reported a
mortality difference of 5% and a 95% confidence interval of -1.2% to
12%. I can't understand how the CI can be unequally distributed if it
uses the form ESTIMATE +/- 1.96 * STANDARD ERROR.

**Not every confidence interval uses a plus or minus type formula**. The
ones that don't are usually asymmetric. In particular, **most
confidence intervals involving ratios are asymemmetric** (though some of
them are symmetric on a log scale). Also **confidence intervals that
take the small sample sizes into account are often asymmetric**. It's
good that you remember your confidence interval formula from your
Statistics class, but your instructor probably didn't have time to show
you every possible confidence interval formula.
