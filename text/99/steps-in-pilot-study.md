*Dear Professor Mean, I am proposing a research study that will examine
a complex intervention of diet, exercise, and behavioral modification
for some of my pediatric patients who need to lose weight. I want to
collect some data from a pilot study before I start the research study.
How do I describe the pilot study in my protocol? \-- Sophisticated

**Short answer**

> **Think of the pilot study as a model of your full research study, but
> on a smaller scale**. Run the pilot study for a briefer time frame
> and/or on fewer subjects. Focus the pilot study on those aspects of
> your full study that are novel, untested, complex, or innovative.
>

> presidential election? We could have avoided a few of these problems
> if someone had run a pilot study on that butterfly ballot in Palm
> Beach County.
>
> It helps if you can clarify the reasons that you want a pilot study.
> These reasons can be loosely classified into two categories
>
> -   To obtain data to help you plan the full study
> -   To see where "Murphy's Law" will strike
>
> There are other reasons to run a pilot study. A pilot study helps
> everyone on your research team get familiar with the procedures in
> your protocol. A pilot study can also help you decide between two
> competing approaches (e.g., collecting data in an interview versus
> using a self-administered survey).

Data for planning

> **Perhaps the most critical piece of data from a pilot study is the
> standard deviation of your outcome measure**. You cannot select an
> appropriate sample size for your study without knowing this value.
>
> If your outcome measure is used very commonly, then you may already
> have an idea what your standard deviation is. Just look at some of the
> papers that you cited in your literature review. It takes a bit of
> hunting sometimes, but usually you can find some estimate of
> variation, such as a standard error, coefficient of variation, or
> confidence interval. Any of these can be converted into a standard
> deviation.
>
> Whether you need to estimate the standard deviation in a pilot study
> depends on the degree of uniqueness and innovation in your experiment.
> Every experiment is unique, of course, but examine whether the use of
> this outcome measure has little or no precedent. Also examine how much
> different your subject population is. An outcome measure that has only
> been used in adults, for example, may make it more important for you
> to get pilot data for your pediatric study.
>
> **If your outcome measure is the probability of some event, then your
> sample size depends on how often the event occurs in your control
> population**. You can use a pilot study to estimate this probability,
> but usually you can get a pretty good estimate of probabilities from
> previous research.
>
> **You should also try to estimate participation rates with your pilot
> study**. How many people do you encounter per month that are eligible
> for your study? How many agree to participate? How many drop out in
> the middle of the study?
>
> **Finally, information from the pilot will help you estimate resource
> requirements**. How much time do you spend per subject? How much money
> do you spend per subject? Both pieces of information are critical for
> preparing the budget for your full study.

**Murphy's Law**

> Murphy's Law says that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.
> **The reason you run a pilot study is to ensure that the things that
> do go wrong, go wrong during the pilot study so you can fix them
> before you start the full study**.
>
> It's impossible to list all ways that a study could go wrong, but
> here are some areas that you should focus on.
>
> **Recruitment and retention problems**
>
> -   Do you get the types of subjects that you think you will get?
> -   Are important segments of your population being left out?
> -   Do a lot of people turn down the opportunity to participate in
>     your study?
> -   Do a lot of people fail to finish your study?
> -   Do a lot of people fail to comply with your protocol requirements?
>
> **Ambiguous situations.**
>
> -   Is it obvious who meets and who does not meet the eligibility
>     requirements?
> -   Do your subjects provide no answer, multiple answers, qualified
>     answers, or unanticipated answers to your survey?
>
> **Time and resource problems**
>
> -   Does it take too long for your subjects to fill out all the survey
>     forms?
> -   Will the study participants overload your phone lines or overflow
>     your waiting room?
> -   How much time does it take to mail out a thousand surveys, and can
>     your tongue lick that many stamps in one day?
>
> **Machinery problems**.
>
> -   Is the equipment readily available when and where you need it?
> -   What happens when it breaks down or gets stolen?
> -   If the machine produces a stream of electronic data, can your
>     computer software read and understand this data?
>
> **Data management problems**.
>
> -   Is there enough room on the data collection form for all of the
>     data you receive?
> -   Do you have any problems entering your data into the computer?
> -   Can you match data that comes in from different sources?
> -   Were any important data values forgotten about?
> -   Does your data show too much or too little variability?
>
> **Uninformative data**
>
> -   Are most of your lab results are below the limit of detection?
> -   Does everybody gives the identical answer to a survey question?
>
> **Blind spots and oversights**. Something will happen during your
> pilot study and you'll say "I never thought about that!" Better to
> have this oversight now than during the full study. Although you can
> and should show ask your colleagues whether there is there anything
> you overlooked in your protocol, it's still a good idea to run a
> pilot study. After all, your colleagues may have the same blind spots
> that you do.

**Other considerations for a pilot study**

> **Don't worry about the representativeness of your pilot subjects**,
> unless you plan to include them in the total sample, or if the
> sampling procedure itself is complex and innovative. Just make sure
> that your pilot subjects cover the entire range of subjects in your
> full study. So if you plan to study this intervention in children ages
> 6-14, make sure that you have some 6 year olds and some 14 year olds
> in your pilot study as well as a bunch in between.

> Also, **don't confuse a pilot study with an exploratory study**. An
> exploratory study will typically try to generate hypotheses for
> further research. Unlike a pilot study, **an exploratory study can
> stand on its own**. Furthermore, you should look for some
> justification of the sample size in an exploratory study. Since such a
> study does not have any pre-specified hypotheses, you justify the
> sample size by showing that some of the estimates produced by the
> study have reasonable precision.

> There is **no explicit justification of the sample size for a pilot
> study**. It depends a lot on the complexity of the study. Be sure
> though, that you aren't just calling their research a pilot study
> just to get out of having to justify the sample size.

> If you are **presenting a pilot study to the IRB**, I encourage you to
> **cite the type of information that the pilot will provide**. Also,
> please be sure to **place the pilot study in the context of the
> full-blown study**. You personally may not be the one who would
> conduct that full-blown study, but you still need to provide that
> context.

**Summary**

> A pilot study is a model of your full research study but on a smaller
> scale. The pilot study helps by **providing data needed to plan the
> larger study** and by **identifying areas where Murphy's Law will
> strike**.
