*Dear Professor Mean, I want to do some research, but before the
hospital won't approve anything until I have a protocol with a research
hypothesis. I'm not sure why a research hypothesis is important. Can
you help? \-- Little Linda*

Dear Little,

Think of it as job security for your local statistician.

**Short answer**

**A research hypothesis provides clarity.** A problem has to be stated
clearly before it can be solved. The research hypothesis will also
provide **direction for writing the rest of your protocol.**

There are several steps that you should follow:

1.  Identify the four components that most research hypotheses have.
2.  Select between a one sided and a two sided hypothesis.
3.  Use your hypothesis to guide the writing of your research protocol.

**Stating a hypothesis**

Ideally, **your research hypothesis should be specified prior to the
collection of any data**. An exception would be an exploratory study.
For example, if you are investigating the cause of poor morale among
health care providers, you may not have enough information to specify
anything more specific than a whole range of factors that might
influence morale.

**In general, a hypothesis will have four major components**. Not every
hypothesis can be fit into this framework, of course, but knowledge of
these four components might help you if you have an incompletely formed
hypothesis.

The **first** component is **the subject group**. In other words, who
are you interested in studying? Subjects could be patients, their
parents, or the health care providers.

The **second** component is **the treatment or exposure**. In other
words, what is being done to part or all of your subject group. A
treatment implies an action on your part, such as providing information
or applying a new therapy. An exposure, on the other hand, implies some
action that you do not control, such as lead poisoning or premature
birth.

The **third** component is **the outcome measure**. In other words, how
or in what manner is the treatment or exposure going to be assessed. It
is very important that the outcome measure be defined precisely and
unambiguously. For example, if your outcome is breast feeding rates, you
should use standard definitions of breast feeding, such as those
provided by the World Health Organization.

The **fourth** component is **the control group**. In other words, who
are you comparing to. It is important for the control group to be as
similar as possible to those who receive a treatment or exposure.

As mentioned earlier, **not every research hypotheses will have all four
components**. For example, a cross-over design involves applying both a
new treatment and a standard treatment using the same patients. For this
study, the hypothesis would not involve a separate control group.
Correlational studies look at relationships within a single group, such
as a study of the factors that cause medication errors. This type of
study would not have a treatment/exposure. The structure mentioned here,
however, is still useful for developing most research hypotheses.

**[]{#OneSided}One sided versus two sided hypotheses**

During the planning of your research, you need to specify whether you
plan to use a one sided or two sided hypothesis. A two sided hypothesis
states that there is a difference between the treatment/exposure group
and the control group, but does not specify in advance what direction
you think this difference will be. A one sided hypothesis states a
specific direction (e.g., increase).

If you expect that a change in either direction is possible and that
changes in either direction are interesting, then you should use a two
sided hypothesis.

If changes in one direction are uninteresting and unpublishable, then
use a one sided hypothesis. Also if a change in the unexpected direction
is equivalent in practice to no change, then use a one sided hypothesis.

The best example of this is when you are comparing a new therapy to an
existing therapy, where the new therapy is much more expensive, your
only concern is to show that the new therapy is better. If it turns out
that then new therapy is equal to or worse than the standard therapy,
you will not adopt it.

**Some important issues involving the control group**

With a treatment, where you intervene, it is often possible to select
those patients who receive the treatment through the use of
randomization. **Randomization ensures comparability**, because the
random selection ensures that, on average, subjects who receive the
treatment will be comparable to subjects who do not receive the
treatment.

When you have an exposure instead, it is often difficult to ensure that
the subjects without the exposure are comparable to the the exposed
subjects. **Sometimes matching will help, but you should only use
matching for very important prognostic variables.** For example, birth
weight plays a major role in infant mortality, so it is often helpful to
match your exposure group to your control group on the basis of birth
weight. Matching, however, will often present difficult logistics,
especially when the pool of control subjects in not much larger than the
pool of exposed subjects.

**What are your next steps?**

Other important issues to be considered in your protocol is

1.  determination of the sample size,
2.  identification of potential confounding variables, and
3.  what efforts at blinding will be used, if any.

Once you have a well defined research hypothesis, though, these details
will fall into place. Hah, hah, did I really say that? The rest of the
protocol is still pretty darn hard, but it would have been impossible if
you didn't have that research hypothesis.

**To determine an appropriate sample size, you need a research
hypothesis, an estimate of the standard deviation of your outcome
measure, and assessment of how much change is considered clinically
relevant**. Hey, you're already a third of the way there! Finding a
standard deviation requires either reviewing previous research on that
outcome measure or running a pilot study. The clinically relevant
difference is a judgement that is made solely on medical knowledge. Your
statistician cannot tell you what a clinically relevant difference would
be.

Confounding variables are those variables which are related to your
outcome measure and which may differ between your treatment/exposure
group and your control group. **Assessment of potential confounding
variables is especially important when you cannot randomize.**

**Blinding means hiding information about the treatment/exposure** from
the patients, their parents, and any health care professional who
interacts with the patients and their parents. Blinding is useful when
it can be done, but blinding is not always possible. For example, in a
comparison of a drug that is rectally administered to oral
administration, the patient usually figures out quickly which group they
are in. But even when the patients themselves know which group they are
assigned to, you can sometimes still use blinding for laboratory
personnel and for interviewers.

**Summary**

Little Linda needs to include a research hypothesis in her grant
proposal, but doesn't know what it should say. Professor Mean explains
that you should develop a hypothesis to giveyour research clarity. There
are four components in most research hypotheses:

1.  a subject group,
2.  a treatment or exposure,
3.  an outcome measure, and
4.  a control or comparison group.

Other important issues to keep in mind while developing a research
hypothesis:

1.  Use a one sided hypothesis when changes in the opposite direction
    are uninteresting.
2.  Randomization helps ensure that you have a comparable control group.
3.  Use the research hypothesis to guide the determination of sample
    size, the identification of confounding variables, and the efforts
    to blind information.
