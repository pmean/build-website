This page is currently being updated from the earlier version of my website. Sorry that it is not yet fully available.

*Dear Professor Mean, Can the Chi-square test be used for anything
besides categorical data?*

> The Chi-square test exists in many different forms. It is useful for
> testing **whether a categorical variable conforms to a set of
> hypothesized probabilities**. It can also test **whether two
> categorical variables are independent**. Both of these tests involve
> comparing expected counts to observed counts.
>
> There is also a Chi-square test for examining **whether a sample
> variance is equal to a hypothesized value**. For this test, you look
> at the ratio of the sample variance to the hypothesized variance.
>
> Finally **many nonparametric tests rely on the Chi-square distribution
> as an approximation** when you don't have exact tables available.
