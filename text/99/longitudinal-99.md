[This is a very early draft]

Longitudinal data are data where each patient is observed on multiple
occasions over time. Analysis of longitudinal data are challenging
because measurements on the same subject are correlated. Another way to
think about this is that two measurements on the same subject will have
less variation than two measurements on different subjects.

A closely related concept is the cluster design. A cluster design is one
where the researcher selects clusters of patients rather than selects
patients individually. For example, a researcher might randomly select
several families and evaluate all children in that family. As another
example, a researcher might randomly select several clinical practices
and then evaluate a random group of patients at each practice. In a
cluster design, two measurements on patients within the same cluster
will have less variations than measurements of two patients in differing
clusters. . In genetics, this correlation is of great interest, and can
help you understand concepts like heritability.

Many of the methods described below for longitudinal designs would also
be useful for cluster designs. For simplicity, I will discuss these
methods solely from the perspective of a longitudinal design.

If your data are continuous, then there are several \"classical\"
approaches such as multivariate analysis of variance and repeated
measures analysis of variance. These approaches work well for simple
well structured longitudinal data.

An alternative is to use mixed linear models. These models handle
missing data well and can handle situations where the times of
measurement vary from one patient to another.

In a mixed linear model, you specify a particular structure for the
correlations. For example, an autoregressive structure is commonly used
to represent structure where correlations are strongest for measurements
close in time and which become weaker for measurements that are further
separated in time.

In many situations, the correlations are not of direct interest, but we
only account for them because failure to do so will lead to incorrect
inferences.

When you are examining the correlation structure, a statistic called the
Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). This statistic measures how closely
the model fits the data, but it includes a penalty for overly complex
models.

Unfortunately, there are two different formulas for AIC. For one
formula, a large value of AIC is good, and for the other formula, a
small value is good.

AIC values should only be compared for models where the only change is
in the correlation structure. It would not make sense to compare an AIC
from a model with linear relationships to a model with quadratic
relationships.

What if your data is not continuous? L. Fang discussed some of the
approaches commonly used when the data represents binomial counts.
