*Dear Professor Mean, In your Simple Descriptive Statistics class, you
described the standard deviation as the square root of the **average**
squared deviation. If it is an average, how come we divide by the
degrees of freedom (n-1) rather than n. Is this just a conspiracy among
statisticians to make this stuff harder to understand.*
