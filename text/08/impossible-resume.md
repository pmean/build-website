This page is currently being updated from the earlier version of my website. Sorry that it is not yet fully available.

I'm updating my resume and found an amusing coincidence. It serves as a
cautionary statement to never make assumptions.

I did a Medline search for any publications in 2007 and 2008 to see if I
had missed any recent publications of mine. Here is a reference that
popped up.

-   **Volitional nonadherence in pediatric asthma: parental report of
    motivating factors.** Graves MM, Adams CD, Bender JA, Simon S,
    Portnoy AJ. Curr Allergy Asthma Rep. 2007 Nov; 7(6): 427-32.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17986372)
    [\[Abstract\]](http://www.current-reports.com/article_frame.cfm?PubID=AL07-6-1-04&Type=Abstract)

I know two of these authors (Adams and Portnoy), but I can't quite
remember what I did that contributed to this paper. It is only on the
[table of contents
page](http://www.current-reports.com/contents.cfm?Volume=7&Issue=6) that
I notice that the S. Simon is actually Stacey Simon and not me. You
wouldn't know this by looking at the medline link or the abstract.

By the way, you're not supposed to do this because it is an indication
of vanity, but everyone does it anyway\--look up your name on Google.

Apparently, I am a great photographer.

I'm also a wonderful painter.

I have an amazing career in the entertainment industry.

I'm the [Assistant Majority Leader of the Minnesota House of
Representatives](http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/members/members.asp?district=44a),
[run a horse ranch in Marietta,
OK](http://www.customcrome.com/ranch.htm), and [write a blog on Florida
Real Estate](http://stevesimon.us/blog/). Apparently I have a page on
MySpace.com, but our hospital's email filter will not let me see it.
Just as well.

If you allow different middle initials and an alternate spelling (Steven
instead of Stephen), I am found on the Internet Movie Database. The list
goes on and on.
