> There was an interesting email exchange on the email discussion group
> [EVIDENCE-BASED-HEALTH\@JISCMAIL.AC.UK](../category/InterestingWebsites.html#EvBaHe).
> The first correspondent (TH) described a series of workshops that are
> intended to help patients access and evaluate health related websites.
> The first workshop will focus on diabetes.
>
> A second correspondent (SH) mentioned a similar project conducted by
> Allan House. I could not find details about this project on the web,
> but Dr. House has co-authored a book, Understanding Clinical Papers,
> that I should buy when I get the chance.
>
> A third correspondent (DB) mentioned an appraisal instrument useful
> for webpages. It includes both usability questions (e.g., is the site
> accessible without a login?) and reliability questions (e.g., is it
> clear who has developed the web site and what their objectives are?).
>
> This looks like an interesting and valuable thing to work on and I\'m
> going to discuss it with some of our EBM experts here where I work.
