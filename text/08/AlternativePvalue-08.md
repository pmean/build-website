**[StATS]:** **An alternative to the p-value (April
3, 2008)**.

> A discussion on edstat-l concerned a statistic called p-rep. I had not
> heard of this statistic before, but at least one journal is calling
> for its use in all papers published by that journal.
>
> There is a nice description of this method in a [publication by Peter
> Killeen](../category/InterestingArticles.html#aatnst), and a detailed
> bibliography plus an Excel spreadsheet is available as a [ZIP
> file](http://www.asu.edu/clas/psych/research/blab/p-reppack_000.zip).
>
> This statistic sounds suspiciously like a post hoc power calculation,
> but I have not examined the formulas in any detail. When things get
> calmer here (they are never completely calm), I will try to describe
> this in more detail.
