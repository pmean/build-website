**[StATS]:** **A short biography that can be used as
an introduction (May 9, 2008)**.

I\'m giving a talk today, and I was asked to provide some material that
could be used to introduce me. Please use any or all of this or to
substitute anything that you feel is appropriate.

Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City, MO. Steve also provides

Evidence-Based Medicine for the Midwest Society for Pediatric Research
for the past four years. He has also taught a short course at London and

(aren\'t you jealous!).

Throughout his career, Steve has been an active researcher. He has
co-authored over 60 publications in a variety of Medical and Statistical
Journals, four of which have won major awards.. He has produced a series
of invited editorials for the Lab Corner of the Journal of Andrology and
