> -   [Category: Interesting books](../category/InterestingBooks.html),
>     and

> Each entry on these pages will have a bookmark, which is the first
> major word in the title (ignoring the, a, etc.) followed by a number

> I had been trying to include new articles, books, and websites as

> books with little or no mathematics, those that provide a good general
> introduction to statistics, those that have more mathematical rigor,
> etc. I also want to develop a top ten list of recommended book. I get
> lots of questions about what book I would recommend, and I can\'t pick
> one over all the others, but I think I can come up with ten that I
> like and that I heartily recommend.

> My goal for all of the articles, books, and websites, is to include a
> brief description. I will also try to include links to the full text
> and./or PDF formats of research articles when they are available.
>
> As of January 1, 2008, I have 81 articles, 75 books, and 37 websites
> in the proper format, though there are literally hundreds of others
> that need to be standardized in this new format. If you have any
> feedback or suggestions, please let me know.
