This page is currently being updated from the earlier version of my website. Sorry that it is not yet fully available.

Most Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) have difficulty coping with the
volume of adverse events that study sponsors report to them. The FDA
held a public meeting about this issue recently, and some written
responses are available as PDF files at the following location:

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [original website][sim2].
