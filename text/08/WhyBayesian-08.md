> parameters in the statistical model. After the data is collected, the
> Bayesian statistician will combine that data with the prior
> distribution to produce a posterior distribution and calculate
> expected values of the posterior distribution (along with other
> quantities from the posterior distribution) to draw conclusions from
> the data. Frequently, the expected values from the posterior
> distribution represent a weighted average of the data and of the prior
> beliefs. If the prior beliefs are strong relative to the data, more
> weight is placed on the prior distribution. If the sample size of the
> data is large relative to the degree of certainty provided by the
> prior distribution, then more weight is placed on the data.

> distribution about accrual patterns, early evidence of problems is
> given greater weight, allowing for rapid interventions to correct the
> slow accrual.
