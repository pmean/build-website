**[StATS]:** **Can I run a quantitative analysis on
this data? (June 17, 2008)**.

I get lots of questions about how small a sample size can be before you
can\'t perform a quantitative analysis and instead are forced to
summarize the data in a qualitative fashion. The most recent question
involved looking at infants with feeding disorders. There were 29 of
these infants, but a subgroup of 5 had disorders so severe that they
still required a feeding tube at 3 years of age. The researcher wanted
to compare this group of 5 to the remaining 24.

There\'s a fuzzy border between the sample sizes that are so small that
you describe them qualitatively and the sample sizes that are just large
enough to allow a quantitative comparison. It\'s based largely on
emotional reactions, which is fine. The problem, of course, is that a
sample size that one person \"feels\" is too small might be more than
enough for another person.

Although there\'s very little quantitative justification for this
border, I do talk about sample sizes that are so small that only an
\"all or nothing\" comparison will achieve statistical significance.

-   [Stats: All or nothing (August 18, 1999)](../size/all.asp)

 By \"all or nothing\" I mean that the worst case in the first group is
still higher than the best case in the second group. A total sample size
of 5 and 5 (10 total) represents an \"all or nothing\" threshold. Since
you have exceeded that value in the second group, you probably have
sufficient justification for running an analysis. Keep in mind, of
course, that it would take a Godzilla sized difference to achieve
statistical significance, but that shouldn\'t stop you.

If you or your boss are uncomfortable, I certainly would not object if
you used a qualitative discussion. There\'s no right or wrong answer
here.
