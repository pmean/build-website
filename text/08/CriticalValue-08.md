**[StATS]:** **What is a critical value? (February
22, 2008)**.

> Someone wrote in asking about the difference between a p-value and a
> critical value. I define a p-value on my web pages already. The
> critical value is typically a percentile from a particular
> distribution or some function of that percentile that a statistic is
> compared to. So, for example, a Z-statistic is often compared to the
> value of plus/minus 1.96. The plus/minus 1.96 is the critical value
> and it represents the 2.5%ile and 97.5%ile of a standard normal
> distribution.
