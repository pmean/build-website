**[StATS]: A brief overview of instrumental
variables (April 14, 2008)**.

> People will often ask me questions that are outside my area of
> expertise. Yes, I know you\'re shocked to hear this, but there are
> lots of areas of statistics where I only have a vague understanding.
> One of these questions was about instrumental variables. I could only
> offer a vague explanation, but I hope that is better than no
> explanation at all.
>
> As I understand it, instrumental variables are used to control for
> measurement error in your independent variables. Measurement error
> causes bias in most regression models. In general, but not always, it
> tends to flatten out or dilute the impact of an independent variable.
> If you want to get an unbiased estimate, you have to use an
> alternative approach. Some of these methods require you to specify the
> specific amount of measurement error that is present in your
> independent variable. Other approaches such as Deming regression
> modify the traditional fitting method of least squares. A third
> approach is to find and use an instrumental variable.
>
> I can\'t provide a formal mathematical definition of an instrumental
> variable, and you probably wouldn\'t want to see such a definition. In
> very simple (overly simplistic?) terms, an instrumental variable is an
> alternative variable which does not suffer from measurement error and
> which only affects the outcome variable through its relationship with
> the independent variable. Such a condition is extremely difficult to
> verify empirically. Most of the time, an instrumental variable is
> identified by a subject matter expert based on their general
> understanding of the area. So a statistician like me is incapable of
> telling you what instrumental variable to use.
>
> Once you identify an instrumental variable, though, the actual
> estimation process is fairly straightforward. It involves estimating
> and fitting two sets of equations simultaneously. For further details,
> consult the Wikipedia article on [Instrumental
> variable](../category/InterestingWebsites.html#insvar) or David
> Kenny\'s webpage on [Instrumental Variable
> Estimation](../category/InterestingWebsites.html#invaes).
