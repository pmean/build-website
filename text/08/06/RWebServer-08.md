**[StATS]:** **Running R on a web server (June 17,
2008)**.

I\'m working on a project for planning and monitoring accrual patterns
in clinical trials. This will eventually lead, I hope, to a grant to
support this work. I have some existing R scripts and want to examine
the possibility of running those scripts on a web page.

The R FAQ has a section on this.

-   [cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html\#R-Web-Interfaces](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#R-Web-Interfaces)

There are a variety of solutions, using
[CGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface),
[Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)),
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), and
[PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php). I\'ll investigate these, but
the one that seems to be the best fit is rwui.

A nice description of this package appears in the October 2007 issue of
R News.

Another possible candidate is CGIwithR. A paper in the Journal of
Statistical Software describes this system.
