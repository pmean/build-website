**[StATS]:** **Type III error (January 3, 2008)**.

> *Dear Professor Mean, What is the definition of a Type III error?*
>
> A Type III error is the belief that there are three types of errors in
> the world. There are only two of course, so if you believe otherwise,
> you are making\...no wait, there really are three types of errors
> after all, so a Type III error is not really an error\...no wait, now
> there are only two types of errors after all. I\'m confused.
>
> There is no official definition of a Type III error. It generally is
> used in a humorous context to point out that statisticians are capable
> of making other types of mistakes rather than just a Type I error and
> a Type II error. A common definition is getting the right answer to
> the wrong hypothesis. A nice summary of the various definitions
> applied for Type III errors (and even Type IV errors) appears in [Type
> I and type II errors](../category/InterestingWebsites.html#Type01)
> (see section 6).
