I was asked to provide some justification for a project I am working on,
case studies in research ethics using a graphic novel format. Here is
what I wrote.

There is a strong need for educational materials about research ethics
and research fraud. Many researchers just starting out their careers are
only vaguely aware of the situations that they are likely to confront.
The saying has been used too much, but it still applies very well
"Those who don't read history are condemned to repeat the mistakes of
the past."

I want to develop a series of case studies. These studies would be
available as PowerPoint presentations that teachers could use in their
classrooms, as web pages that researchers could use as self-training,
and in a book form that would be an excellent supplementary text for
courses on research methodology.

I want to use an unusual format for these case studies: a graphic novel
format. The graphic novel format is unfamiliar to many, and the common
tendency is to treat them as if they are comic books for children.
Graphic novels, however, are targetted at adults. While this is
predominantly a format for fiction writing, there are notable
exceptions. "Maus: A Survivor's Tale\--My Father Bleeds History" by
Art Spiegelman recounted the story of a survivor of the Holocaust. This
book won the Pulitzer Prize in 1992. Another prominent non-fiction
writer using the graphic novel format is Larry Gonnick, who has written
"The Cartoon Guide to\..." in various scientific and historical areas,
including chemistry, genetics, physics, and statistics.

The graphic novel format is ideally suited for case studies in research
ethics because:

1.  it makes the stories more accessible. A graphic novel format is easy
    to pick up and read.
2.  it shows the range of human emotion better than text can. The
    stories involving research ethics issues involves serious suffering:
    in some stories emotional and in other real physical suffering.
    Illustrations combined with text can convey this far better than
    text alone.
3.  the target audience for these case studies, young people starting
    out their research careers are a demographic group that are already
    heavy consumers of this type of publishing.

I propose to illustrate an important case study, the TGN-1412 trials,
and make it available on my web pages as a PowerPoint presentation and
as a series of web pages with questions at the end. The web pages would
satisfy an immediate need for more ethics training opportunities for CMH
employees. These case studies would add some variety and offer a break
from all the traditional didactic lectures that I others currently
offer.

More importantly, having a single well-illustrated case study would
allow me to seek funding to support work on additional case studies.
Having a particular case study in graphic novel format will make it
easier to "sell" the idea for additional funding.

If I were able to attract funding for this project, this would be a high
visibility example that would enhance Childrens Mercy's reputation in
the research community. The potential audience for this type of work
would be huge.

The initial investment to produce a single case study would be fairly
minimal, but there is potential to attract funding and produce a
valuable product that has high demand and which would greatly enhance
the visibility of CMH.
