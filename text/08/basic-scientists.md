This page is currently being updated from the earlier version of my website. Sorry that it is not yet fully available.

Someone wrote to a mailing list sponsored by the American Statistical
Association asking about what resources to use in a statistics class
aimed at basic scientists (as opposed to public health students and
clinical scientists). I offered a few general recommendations.

Robin Penslar's book on Research Ethics should be incorporated
somewhere into any researcher's curriculum. I would think that a class
on Statistics is as good a place as any, as many problems with ethics
involve data fudging, violation of statistical protocols, and
carelessness with private data. These are issues that Statisticians can
and should speak about.

There is also a wealth of data available on the Internet these days that
students should review and identify projects. I would encourage the use
of a large data set such as in genomics. There is a fascinating data set
looking at microarray expression levels of 19 different human tissue
types in 30 different individuals. The basic setup is described at

-   <http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/15/3/443>

and the article has a link to supplemental research data that includes
the full data set in a text file that is surprisingly easy to
manipulate.

There are other interesting data sources like this. Perhaps it would be
interesting to ask students to provide a simple analysis of a subset of
a very large data set like this one. The days of having to live with
small toy data sets is over.

Anyone working in a laboratory should be familiar with the basic tools
of quality control including control charts, fishbone diagrams, and
Pareto charts. If you were really ambitious, you might consider
screening designs as well.

As a general rule, basic science should place more emphasis on
randomized designs, especially block designs and multifactorial designs.
It should place less emphasis on Epidemiology topics, such as
case-control designs and risk adjustment models. Of course, you can't
totally ignore Epi.
