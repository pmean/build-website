The following 41 observations:

8, 2, 26, 29, 1, 2, 11, 8, 0, 5, 10, 1, 4, 9, 12, 3, 6, 5, 2, 12, 1,
5, 3, 5, 7, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 1, 0, 4, 8, 1, 8, 12, 0, 6, 1, 5

represent waiting times that we suspect follow an exponential
distribution. There are several ways to examine this belief.

The simplest way to to draw a Q-Q plot for the exponential distribution.

You need to compare the sorted values of the waiting times with 41
evenly spaced percentiles from an exponential distribution. Since the
exponential distribution represents a family of distributions, you
need to select a particular distribution. The easiest choice is to
select the distribution that has the same mean as the actual data
(5.83). These percentiles can be obtained in R using the following
line of code

`qu <- qexp((1:41)/42,rate=1/5.83)`

which produces the following values (after rounding)

0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2,
2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 3.0, 3.3, 3.5, 3.8, 4.0, 4.3, 4.6, 4.9, 5.3, 5.6,
6.0, 6.4, 6.8, 7.3, 7.8, 8.4, 9.0, 9.7, 10.4, 11.3, 12.4, 13.7,
15.4, 17.7, 21.8

Plotting these values yields the following graph.

A straight line is evidence of consistency between the data and the
exponential distribution. Note that the two largest data points seem
out of line, but a fair amount of latitude should probably be allowed
at the upper tail. You can simulate these graphs under an actual
exponential distribution to get a feel for sampling error.

This approach can be applied to other distributions as well. Note that
in many situations, it simplifies the interpretation by selecting the
distribution using the same mean (as above) or in some settings the
same mean and standard deviation. This is knwon as matching the
moments and is actually an optional step for most Q-Q plots.

The Q-Q plot does not provide a formal test of hypothesis and there is
a tendency to overstate small departures from linearity. Still, it is
a useful approach that is easy to explain.
