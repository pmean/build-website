This page is currently being updated from the earlier version of my website. Sorry that it is not yet fully available.

A group called The Edge (www.edge.org) asks a question each year of
prominent scientists and a few select non-scientists. This group
represents from a broad range of backgrounds and disciplines and
provides an interesting variety of responses. Questions asked in the
past include:

-   What are you optimistic about?
-   What is your dangerous idea? and
-   What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it?

Just recently, this group published responses to the 2008 question: What
have you changed your mind about? Why? Several of the responses touch
directly or indirectly on Statistics.

-   Rebecca Goldstein criticizes the concept of falsifiability:
    [edge.org/q2008/q08\_9.html\#goldstein](http://edge.org/q2008/q08_9.html#goldstein).
-   Gerd Gigerenzer is no longer so pessimistic about whether
    physicians, patients, and politicians could adopt and apply basic
    statistical literacy techniques to questions about health:
    [edge.org/q2008/q08\_13.html\#gigerenzer](http://edge.org/q2008/q08_13.html#gigerenzer).
-   Beatrice Golomb cites the medical community's change of mind about
    various treatments and cites the randomized trials of
    post-menopausal hormone therapy as a particular example:
    [edge.org/q2008/q08\_15.html\#golomb](http://edge.org/q2008/q08_15.html#golomb).
-   Bart Kosko now prefers to use the sample median rather than the
    sample mean to combine measurements into a single predictive value:
    [edge.org/q2008/q08\_16.html\#kosko](http://edge.org/q2008/q08_16.html#kosko).
-   Nassim Taleb no longer believes in the centrality of probability:
    [edge.org/q2008/q08\_17.html\#taleb](http://edge.org/q2008/q08_17.html#taleb).

I might as well put my thoughts in as well. I no longer believe that
statisticians are the gatekeepers to scientific integrity and that we
need to impose certain restrictions on how data should be analyzed
(e.g., only allow parametric tests when there is evidence that the
assumptions of normality are met). I believe that scientists are
sophisticated enough to understand rules of evidence and to apply them
fairly in the absence of statistical input.
