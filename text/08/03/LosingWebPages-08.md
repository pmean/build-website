**[StATS]:** **Losing web pages in the mass of
information (created 2008-03-05)**.

> Part of the personal value I get from these web pages is making note

> which never got assigned a category. I\'ve fixed that and hope that

> The philosophy of biostatistics was of interest to me because a recent

> -   **Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures**. Leo Breiman.
>     Statistical Science 2001; 16(3): 199-231.

> The lead article was about a predictive model which won a million

> I also want to revise my bibliographic entries so that each is clearly
> tied to a particular category or categories. I also want to annotate

> bibliographic entries, I\'m hoping that the assigning of categories
> and inclusion of annotations will make my bibliographic entries more
> useful.
