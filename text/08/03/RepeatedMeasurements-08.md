**[StATS]:** **Simplifying repeated measurements
(March 12, 2008)**.

> I received an email inquiry about a project that involved four repeat
> assessments on 10 different subjects. The question started out as, is
> my sample size 10 or is it 40?
>
> My immediate response was to ask for more details, but to also point
> out that 4 repeated measurements on 10 subjects is not the same as 40
> independent observations. There is almost always a positive
> correlation among these measurements and that implies a level of
> redundancy. You don\'t get as much information as you would with 40
> independent observations.
>
> But it is not the same as a sample size of 10 either. The repeated
> measurements do add a level of precision, so you have more information
> than if you collected a single measurement on 10 subjects.
>
> I then suggested that sometimes a design like this could be greatly
> simplified if you calculated a single summary statistic across the
> four measurements. For example, an average of the four measurements, a
> maximum value, or a difference between the first and last measurements
> might all be useful. At other times, however, such a summary would be
> overly simplistic and should be avoided.
>
> It turns out that the data was categorical, so a change score or mean
> would be inappropriate. But the categories did have a natural ordering
> and selecting the maximum value was a good solution.
>
> Repeated measurements lead to some of the most difficult problems with
> data management and with data analysis and the solutions are often
> very dependent on the context in which the repeated measurements were
> done.
