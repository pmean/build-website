**[StATS]:** **A simple math error (created
2008-04-06)**.

> People write in once in a while to correct errors on my webpages. God
> bless them! I had an error on my [What is a
> P-value?](../08a/www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/pvalue.htm) page.
>
> The p-value involved a comparison of two proportions 91% and 82%. I
> had listed the two fractions as 171 / 240 and 586 / 719. The first
> fraction is clearly too small to produce 91%. I had actually misread
> the table in the paper, and the fraction should have been written as
> 219 / 240.
>
> This has been fixed, but it will take a few days to upload the fix.
>
> I greatly appreciate people who find these things for me. Perhaps the
> best example of eagle-eyed proof-reading was someone who noted that my
> bibliographic reference on [Stats: Odds ratio versus relative risk
> (January 9, 2001)](../journal/oddsratio.asp) to Fahey 1996 should
> actually be Fahey 1995. That\'s an eye for detail that I have to
> admire.
