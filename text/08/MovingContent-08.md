**[StATS]:** **Moving content to a private site
(created 2008-03-12)**.

> I may be setting up a private website to complement the material on
> this website that Children\'s Mercy Hospital has been so grateful to
> provide for me. This would include content that is inappropriate for a
> hospital site (such as personal news and updates), but I might move
> some of the other material to that site as well.

> To set up a private site, you need to register a domain name with a
> [domain name
> registrar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar). Then
> you contact an [Internet hosting
> service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hosting_services) to
> place your site. There\'s a lot of controversy about the process of
> registering domain names, but it would be difficult to summarize that
> here. There are companies that bundle both services together. For
> example, Microsoft has a product, [Office
> Live](http://www.officelive.com/), that provides domain name
> registration, web hosting, reporting tools, and other useful tools.
