This page is currently being updated from the earlier version of my website. Sorry that it is not yet fully available.

> On my thousand plus web pages, I have included various other
> resources: peer-reviewed articles, books, and websites. These have
> been handled in a haphazard fashion, and my attempts to standardize
> the formats (most notably in Professor Mean's Library) have been only
> partially successful. I have been experimenting with a new format. I
> want something that is useful to you loyal readers of my webpages
> while still being easy for me to maintain and update.
>
> My new format, which I hope will work, is to list all these other
> resources in
>
> -   [Category: Interesting
>     articles](../category/InterestingArticles.html),
> -   [Category: Interesting books](../category/InterestingBooks.html),
>     and
> -   [Category: Interesting
>     websites](../category/InterestingWebsites.html)
>
> Each entry on these pages will have a bookmark, which is the first
> major word in the title (ignoring the, a, etc.) followed by a number
> (usually 01). I also have a closely related page,
>
> -   [Category: Interesting quotes](../quote/InterestingQuotes.asp)
>
> that you might find useful.
>
> I had been trying to include new articles, books, and websites as
> individual weblog entries, but that was just too much work. By placing
> all of the entries on the same page, I can see all the entries
> together and fix any formatting inconsistencies. I can also produce
> new compilations. In my [interesting
> books](../category/InterestingBooks.html) page, I highlight those
> books with little or no mathematics, those that provide a good general
> introduction to statistics, those that have more mathematical rigor,
> etc. I also want to develop a top ten list of recommended book. I get
> lots of questions about what book I would recommend, and I can't pick
> one over all the others, but I think I can come up with ten that I
> like and that I heartily recommend.
>
> My goal for all of the articles, books, and websites, is to include a
> brief description. I will also try to include links to the full text
> and./or PDF formats of research articles when they are available.
>
> As of January 1, 2008, I have 81 articles, 75 books, and 37 websites
> in the proper format, though there are literally hundreds of others
> that need to be standardized in this new format. If you have any
> feedback or suggestions, please let me know.
