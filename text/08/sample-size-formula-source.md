*Hello, I am looking at your [page on sample size
calculation](http://www.childrensmercy.org/stats/size/power.asp), and
I\'m curious as to where you got the equation shown there:*

*I can\'t seem to find that exact form in Cohen\'s book, not does it
appear anywhere else that I\'ve looked. Would you happen to know its
original source?*

I\'m away from all my books for the time being, so I can only
speculate. If you let the two standard deviations be equal, then the
formula simplifies somewhat.

I can\'t say for sure what Cohen\'s formula is, but I suspect that it
assumes both variances are equal.

Some formulas will place the common standard deviation in the
denominator of this equation, which yields

The quantity

is sometimes called the effect size, and is often called Cohen\'s d
(notice the change from upper case to lower case).

Some formulas will substitute a t distribution for the z distribution
although this requires iteration, as the degrees of freedom are
dependent on the sample size. This is a slightly better approximation,
but the best answer will come from the non-central t-distribution. You
would have to rely on tables or software for any power or sample size
calculation involving the non-central t-distribution..

As far as a source, I suspect you would find this formula in many
textbooks. Perhaps Rosner would be a good source.

-   Fundamentals of Biostatistics. Bernard Rosner (1990) Belmont,
    California: Duxbury Press. ISBN: 0-534-91973-1. Description:
    Bernard Rosner provides a good solid introduction to Statistics
    with nice examples of sample size calculations. This book is good
    for someone looking for an introduction to statistics.

If there\'s a different formula from a definitive source, I would not
be at all offended if you used it instead.
