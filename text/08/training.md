### Which class should I take first?

It doesn't really matter much which class you take. All of the classes stand on their own and don't have any pre-requisites. The most popular class by far is Stats #01: "Using SPSS to Manage Your Research Data." Almost everyone has to worry about data management. It is the first step before any others. Another popular class, and one that is good to take early is Stats #02: "Using SPSS to Describe Your Data."  It covers some very basic graphs and tables that are useful for almost every situation.

### Can this class qualify for IRB Education Credits (IRBECs)?

After several discussions with Kathy Johnson, we tentatively agreed that classes talking about how to design a good research study should qualify for IRBECs. Many of my classes should therefore qualify. For now, I have identified classes 22, 32-35, 36, 42, 44, 51 and 52 as covering material relating to study design that would allow them to have IRBECs. The number of IRBECs would equal the length of the class, so a three hour class would earn you 3 IRBECs. This policy is still evolving. I will work closely with Kathy and with other members of the IRB to be sure that these classes address issues of importance from the IRB perspective.
