Someone wrote in asking about the difference between a p-value and a
critical value. I define a p-value on my web pages already. The
critical value is typically a percentile from a particular
distribution or some function of that percentile that a statistic is
compared to. So, for example, a Z-statistic is often compared to the
value of plus/minus 1.96. The plus/minus 1.96 is the critical value
and it represents the 2.5%ile and 97.5%ile of a standard normal
distribution.
