This page is obsolete. I am keeping it around mostly for nostalgic reasons.

<!---More--->

I get a lot of questions about Poisson regression. I feel embarrassed when this happens because my pages on this topic are woefully incomplete. Everything on my web pages is incomplete to some extent, of course, but this is an area with the biggest gaps. I have been planning for quite a while to write more about this topic, and here are some of the areas I want to discuss.

Comparing two Poisson counts and extending it to comparing two rates.

Power calculations for Poisson regression

Poisson regression for continuous predictor variables.

Fitting Poisson regression models using iteratively reweighted least squares.

Overdispersion in a Poisson regression model.

Poisson models versus “time to event” models.

If you're one of the people who want to know more about this topic, let me know which area is most important to you so I can prioritize my efforts.

Further reading (I'll add more details about these links as soon as I can)
