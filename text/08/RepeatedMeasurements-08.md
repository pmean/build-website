> out that 4 repeated measurements on 10 subjects is not the same as 40
> independent observations. There is almost always a positive
> correlation among these measurements and that implies a level of
> redundancy. You don't get as much information as you would with 40
> independent observations.

> four measurements. For example, an average of the four measurements, a
> maximum value, or a difference between the first and last measurements
> might all be useful. At other times, however, such a summary would be
> overly simplistic and should be avoided.

> and selecting the maximum value was a good solution.
