**[StATS]: Monitoring refusals and exclusions in a
clinical trial (created 2008-05-01 with major update on 2008-05-29)**.

> Someone sent me an email asking about the work that Byron Gajewski and
> I have done on monitoring accrual patterns in clinical trials. She had
> been doing something similar at her job and wanted to see if we could
> collaborate.
>
> In her situation, the major issue was
>
> 1.  the number of patients who made an initial contact but did not
>     keep their first appointment,
> 2.  the number of patients who kept the appointment, but refused to
>     sign the consent form once they realized what the study was about,
>     and
> 3.  the number of patients who did sign the consent form, but who did
>     not meet the inclusion criteria once the initial screening was
>     done.
>
> Her data is interesting because her company recruits to multiple
> centers. The accrual pattern is also interesting, because in her job,
> she sees a sudden burst of recruits once an ad is placed, this will
> settle down and then another burst will occur when another ad is
> placed.
>
> The loss of subjects during the course of recruitment is quite severe.
> Only one in every 20 patients makes it from the initial contact
> through all of the steps to final enrolment and randomization in the
> study. Such a large loss is probably unavoidable, because you can\'t
> bypass the consent process and you can\'t let just anyone into these
> studies. But clearly this loss has tremendous economic implications
> and we need to carefully plan for these losses and monitor them during
> the course of the study.
>
> The geometric distribution provides an excellent approach to model the
> losses of patients prior to enrollment. The geometric distribution can
> be characterized as the number of independent Bernoulli trials

>     fails to show up at the first appointment.
> -   **Stage 2**: At the initial appointment, the volunteer reviews the
>     details of the study and does not want to join the study.
> -   **Stage 3**: After the consent form is signed, the volunteer gets
>     some medical tests done. These tests show that the patient is
>     ineligible for the trial.

> The researcher estimates the probability of success at each of the
> three stages to be 20%, 90%, and 50%. The overall rate of success
> (surviving all three stages) is simply the product of these three
> probabilities (9%). This is a very small number, but represents the

> join these trials, and it may be dangerous to set too broad an

> critically dependent on these values and even small declines in the
> success probabilities could produce major delays. It, therefore,
> becomes critical to plan these values carefully and to monitor them

> Since this is retrospective data, the success probabilities were

> (30% success rate). There were 2,084 who signed the consent form (85%
