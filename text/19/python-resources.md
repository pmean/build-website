I have not had the time to learn Python yet, but it is on my short term
list of research goals. I attended a very nice talk about Python and
data science and tried to get a list of interesting resources in Python
from that talk. Here is my incomplete and imperfect list.

<!---More--->

Sphinx is a tool to autodocument your Python code. It is similar in
spirit to R Markdown. A tutorial on Sphinx is available in [html
format](https://codeandchaos.wordpress.com/2012/07/30/sphinx-autodoc-tutorial-for-dummies/)
on the Code and Chaos blog.

Zeppelin is a notebook for Python code that can also integrate code in
Scala, Spark, SQL and many others (but not R, unfortunately). It is
similar in spirit to R Studio or Jupyter. Zeppelin is an open source
system and documented on the Apache web site in [html
format](https://zeppelin.apache.org/).

Pyspark is a Python implementation of Spark, a system for distributed
computing. It is also an open source system documented on the Apache web
site in [html
format](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.3/api/python/pyspark.html).

Pytorch is a Python system for deep learning. Deep learning is a subset
of machine learning associated with various neural network systems. It
is open source and available on a dedicated website in [html
format](https://pytorch.org/).

Runawayhorse001 is the [github site](https://github.com/runawayhorse001)
for the George Feng, who gave the talk listing all these resources. He
is developing some interesting tutorial resources, mostly for Python. He
works at [DST systems](http://www.dstsystems.com/), a company
headquartered in Kansas City that provides consulting in the financial
and health care markets.

I asked a question at the end of this talk about running Pyspark on a
cluster of Raspberry Pis and got the suggestion to look at the
[Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/). Kubernetes is a
system for maintaining containers and providing a portable cloud
solution.

Data Science KC, the group that sponsored this talk, has a [meetup
page](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-KC/) and a [slack
channel](https://datasciencekc.slack.com/). In order to use the slack
channel, you need to register as a free user at the [Slack
website](https://slack.com/).
