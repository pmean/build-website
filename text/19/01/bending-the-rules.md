Many clinical trials have restrictive entry criteria to insure
homogeneity of the subject pool which increases power and allows the
study to proceed with a not too outrageous sample size. But what if you

trial, but does not meet the entry criteria? This study discusses the
ethical problems that ensue when a doctor is faced with such a
choice.
