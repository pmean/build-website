Building a great statistical model does no one any good if it doesn't
pay attention to non-statistical issues. This story talks about a
machine learning model to identify which houses in Flint Michagan that
were the best candidates for removal of lead pipes. The model worked
fairly well, but came up against problems like individual city council
members wanting to assure their constituents that enough was being done
in their district. I'm not sure what the actual moral of this story is,
but it does serve as a warning to be careful when you are modeling data
in a contentous area.
