The introduction section of your research thesis or dissertation is the
first thing that most people will read after reading the abstract. Some
people use the introduction section to provide a literature review, and
I won't talk about that here. I did offer a nice recommendation on how
to write a literature review in an [earlier
post](../literature-review/index.html). The introduction should provide
present your research problem (research question, research hypothesis),
but first you have to offer some context.

<!---More--->

What does context mean? It varies from study to study, but in a health
care setting, the context almost always involves people. They might be
people with a particular disease, or people who are getting a particular
type of care, people exposed to something harmful, or people in a
particular demographic group. Describe the disease, care, or exposure in
broad details. Here are some examples.

-   Obesity is a disease with increased morbidity due to several
    conditions including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and
    cancer, and it is associated with increased risk of overall
    mortality. [Salvolainen
    2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6336486/).
-   Mobile health (mHealth) in the form of applications (apps) designed
    to be used on devices such as smartphones and tablets is a vast and
    growing industry, with more than 318 000 apps available globally
    in 2017. [Lewis
    2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6419251/).
-   Worldwide, the total number of elderly people is growing more
    rapidly compared to other age groups. [Uddin
    2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6068532/).

Note that the context is far broader than any particular intervention
could address. That's okay. You start with a broad area because you want
everyone to feel comfortable with your topic and not just those who are
highly specialized in your area.

Then add a second dimension to the mix.

-   Bariatric surgery is considered as a highly effective treatment
    option for severe to morbid obesity, some form or variation of
    gastric bypass being the most common procedure after unsuccessful
    conservative treatments.
-   Although most of these apps relate to general well-being such as
    diet and fitness, an increasing number now focus on chronic disease
    management.
-   A major challenge in handling an aging population is the effective
    delivery of healthcare services.

Now you can bring in a third dimension, if you like. Or you can narrow
down one of the first two dimensions to a more manageable size. Get to a
specific problem that needs to be solved.

-   Until recently, the role of physical activity has been considered
    minimal in bariatric surgery patients, and at the moment, there are
    no physical activity guidelines for bariatric surgery patient
    population.
-   However, with so many health apps available, choosing those that are
    most useful can be overwhelming for consumers.
-   Why are marginalized groups using combustible tobacco so heavily?
-   However, an overview of non-wearable ambient sensor-based systems
    would be valuable for analyzing the increasingly complicated care
    demands of elderly people.

This has to be a problem that is largely unsolved. Otherwise, why are
you doing the research. Talk briefly about some of the failed attempts
or about the gaps in knowledge or the preliminary nature of proposed
solutions or something else that implies a deficiency.

Then introduce your work as an attempt to address this deficiency.

-   As skeletal muscle is a major site of glucose usage and peripheral
    insulin resistance, the aim of the current study was to investigate
    whether self-reported habitual physical activity associates with
    improved insulin sensitivity in whole-body level and especially in
    skeletal muscle tissue after bariatric surgery.
-   The purpose of this review was to systematically identify apps
    targeted at people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) including those
    requiring maintenance dialysis and especially those apps that
    promote or support self-management.
-   However, an overview of non-wearable ambient sensor-based systems
    would be valuable for analyzing the increasingly complicated care
    demands of elderly people.

You may end up repeating this structure in more detail in your
literature review. The difference, other than length, is that you want
more of the focus in the Introduction to be on your research. You only
give enough context in the Introduction so that people can understand
the research problem and your proposed solution.

Now I have to admit that I cheated here. The examples I used are from
papers that do not have an introduction that is separate from the
literature review. To be honest, it looks like the separation between
the introduction and the literature review occurs mostly for theses and
dissertations, rather than research papers. I hope that this summary is
still helpful, and I will try to find better examples, possibly from
actual theses and dissertations when I have time.

Meanwhile, there are a ton of good resources on this topic out on the
Internet. Here are a few.
