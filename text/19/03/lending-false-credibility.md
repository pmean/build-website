A rather harsh and cynical take on data science, but still worth
reading. Let me share a story about this. Back in my college days (that
would be the 1970s), someone found a New Yorker cartoon and shared it
with me. It showed a politician, obviously a very powerful politician
because his office had a view of the Washington Monument. He was
speaking to his aide "That's the gist of what I want to say. Now go and
find me some statistics to base it on." So the issues that this person
brings up are no different than those from four decades ago. There's no
easy solution to the problem. You can't say, "I'll only work with people
who have a commitment to the truth, no matter where it might lead"
because even people without strong overt biases still have subtle biases
that can profoundly skew the results. Requiring a priori specifications
and reserving a hold out sample for a final quality check can help, but
mostly it is just being careful and detail oriented and transparent in
all your work.
