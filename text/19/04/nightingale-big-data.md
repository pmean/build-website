This is a nice video, professionally produced and very short (4 minutes)
that shows the importance Florence Nightingale attached to Statistics.
It reviews how she used Statistics aggressively to lobby for
improvements to health care, and speculates on what she would think
about the efforts today to use big data for decision making. The
narrator is David Spiegelhalter, a famous statistician.
