I dated a piano major in college and I tried
- with very limited success,
to learn how to play the piano myself. She told me
- "If you're going to
make a mistake
- make a loud mistake." You don't want to play the piano
nervously and hesitantly. The same is true in research. 

<!---More--->

If you deviate from a well-established research norm
- do so boldly and
explicitly. Say something like "Although this quasi-experimental study
has some limitations
- it avoids many of the well-documented problems
with a randomized trial" And then elaborate. Don't apologize for your
research design. Brag about how it is the best approach for this
particular problem and explain what advantages it offers over a
randomized trial.

A bold approach sounds dangerous
- but actually a timid approach will
hurt you here. If you use an approach that is commonly thought to be
weaker
- and you avoid talking about it in the hope that whoever is
reviewing your work won't notice
- bad things will happen. They will hold
the weaker approach against you anyway
- but they will also conclude that
you are naive and unable to recognize the well-known flaws of your
approach.
