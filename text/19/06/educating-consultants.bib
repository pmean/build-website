 abstract = {This article describes an expanded approach to the education of statistical consultants that is being implemented at Florida State University. Our program begins with a preconsulting course in which students first study general problem-solving techniques. Next these techniques are used in solving applied statistics "textbook" problems. Then problem formulation and research methods are studied. Finally the structure of consulting sessions is considered, along with interpersonal issues that arise in consulting. In the supervised consulting course, students work with actual clients in videotaped sessions, attend supervision sessions in which the tapes are reviewed, present case conferences, attend new material sessions, and complete a project. We conclude this article with preliminary evaluation data on the program and observations regarding what we have learned.},
