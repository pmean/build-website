You can incorporate very nice looking mathematical formulas in R
Markdown fairly easily. The system relies on LaTeX for displaying
formulas and is surprisingly easy to learn. But every once in a while
you want to do something a bit exotic, like placing a "hat" in your
equation. I've typically just done a quick Google search on something
like "LaTeX hat symbol" and each different search yields a different
website. Recently, I stumbled up a fairly comprehensive guide to
displaying mathematical formulas in LaTex. It is published as an eBook.

Note: Some of the examples require additional libraries like amsmath and
I haven't figured out yet how to take advantage of these libraries in R
Markdown.
