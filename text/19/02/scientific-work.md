"All scientific work is incomplete, whether it be observational or
experimental. All scientific work is liable to be upset or modified by
advancing knowledge. That does not confer upon us a freedom to ignore
the knowledge we already have, or to postpone the action that it appears
to demand at a given time. Who knows, asked Robert Browning, but the
world may end tonight? True, but on available evidence most of us make
ready to commute on 8:30 the next day." Sir Austin Bradford Hill, as
quoted in his [landmark 1965 paper on
causation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1898525/).
