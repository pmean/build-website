abstract = {These days, the very word "data" elicits fear and suspicion in many of us â€” and with good reason. DNA-testing companies are sharing genetic information with the government. A firm hired by the Trump campaign gained access to the private information of 50 million Facebook users. Hotels, hospitals, and a consumer credit reporting agency have admitted to major breaches. But while many of us are rightfully concerned about the misuse of our personal data by private entities, we should be just as worried about the important national stories that aren't told when our fellow citizens don't feel secure enough to share theirs with researchers.},
