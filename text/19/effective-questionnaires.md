I had originally cited this resources on my [survey design category page][sim1], but the link was broken, so here is the correct link. It's a nice guide. A bit too firm in its opinions, perhaps, but still well worth reading.

Robery Frary. Hints for Designing Effective Questionnaires. Practical Assessment, Research & Evaluation; 5(3): November 1996. Available in [PDF format][fra1].
