This is one of those articles where you have to restrain yourself. Its
message, that good old statistical tools like logistic regression can
perform as well as these new fangled machine learning approaches that
you haven't taken the time to learn, is quite tempting. But I'd be
cautious here. Maybe logistic regression is still competitive, but maybe
the systematic overview got a bunch of biased studies. It's worthwhile
to cite this whenever someone makes an overly strong claim about machine
learning models, but don't use this as an excuse to keep from learning
the new stuff yourself. This article is stuck behind a paywall.
Sorry!
