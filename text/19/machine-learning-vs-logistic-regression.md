This is one of those articles where you have to restrain yourself. Its message - that good old statistical tools like logistic regression can perform as well as these new fangled machine learning approaches that you haven't taken the time to learn - is quite tempting. But I'd be cautious here. Maybe logistic regression is still competitive - but maybe the systematic overview got a bunch of biased studies. It's worthwhile to cite this whenever someone makes an overly strong claim about machine learning models - but don't use this as an excuse to keep from learning the new stuff yourself. This article is stuck behind a paywall. Sorry!
