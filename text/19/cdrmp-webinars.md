We live in a golden age of learning, where you find find just about anything you'd ever need to learn from on the Internet. One example of this is a series of webinars about who to get research funding through the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDRMP). I have not listened yet to any of these webinars, but they look like they would be very helpful for anyone seeking funding through this program.
