This video was recommended by my niece, and it caught my eye for a more
subtle theme, perhaps. Rachel Ignotofsky is a great believer that
illustration makes difficult material more accessible. This supports an
idea I've had for a while to develop a book of case studies in research
ethics using a graphic novel format. Anyway, the video also emphasizes
the importance of recognizing barriers of sexism, racism, and classism
that many great women scientists have faced and overcome. This video is
a fairly easy 15 minutes to listen to.
