This is a brief summary of a research paper (apparently behind a pay
wall, boo!) that looked at the language used in research grants
submitted to the Gates Foundation. It found differences by gender in
word choices. Men are more likely to choose "broad" words versus women
who choose "narrow" words. These two terms are put in quotes because
what you and I think they might mean are different from how the
researchers defined them. Read the paper to find out more about this. It
is definitely worth reading, even if you might disagree with the authors
definitions of broad and narrow.
