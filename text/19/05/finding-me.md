It is worth tracking the limited number of websites that mention me (and
[not people who share my first and last
name](http://www.pmean.com/08/ImpossibleResume.html)). Here are a few
places where I get mentioned, albeit very briefly in some
cases.

I received an [honorable mention in an R programming contest run by
Revolution
Analytics](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2012/01/announcing-the-winners-of-the-applications-of-r-in-business-contest.html)
back in 2012. I actually got a \$1,000 check for this, which makes it
\$1,000 better than any other awards I have received. Interestingly,
Yihui Xie is also listed among the honorable mentions for his early work
on the knitr package. He has gone on to great fame and deservedly so,
while I still toil in relative anonymity, again deservedly so. It is
flattering that my work in 2012 and his were considered to be
comparable.

I wrote two brief articles about consulting in the April and August 2017
issues of Amstat News. These are not peer-reviewed articles. Amstat News
is more like a newsletter than a peer-reviewed journal. Still, it is
worth noting. The first article, [Why Be an Independent
Consultant?](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2017/04/01/whyconsult/),
talks about the bad things and the good things that you will experience
if you start your own consulting business. The second article, [Getting
Paid: How to Determine Your
Fee](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2017/08/01/consultants-corner-getting-paid/),
talks about the two ways to bill: by the hour and by the project.

While searching for these two Amstat News articles, I came across three
others that mentioned my name, though for something that is not quite so
impressive. Starting in
[2017](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2017/04/01/recognizing-the-asas-longtime-members/),
and repeated in
[2018](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2018/04/01/longtime-members/)
and
[2019](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2019/04/01/longtimemember19/), I
have made the American Statistical Associations list of longtime
members. You have to use the search function to find me in the very long
list of members of 35-39 years. I think that I won't move to the next
higher category (40-44 years) until 2022.
