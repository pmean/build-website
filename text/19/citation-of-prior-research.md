This was a nice study, and shows a very easy model to adapt to other
research problems. The authors were concerned that many reports of
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) seemed to miss out on citing previous
RCTs on the same topic. So they dug out a bunch of meta-analysis and
looked at the bibliographies of the individual RCTs in those trials. The
meta-analysis gives you a reasonably comprehensive history of the RCTs
done on a particular topic, and you would think that any RCTs in the
meta-analysis should have cited any other RCT in that same meta-analysis
that preceded it by at least one year. But that happened very
rarely.
