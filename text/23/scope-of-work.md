<div class="notes">

I attended a great panel discussion at the Conference on Statistical Practice on how to write a scope of work. Most of the panelists cited Peterson et al 2022 in their remarks. A second article on how to write a statistical analysis plan, Cressman and Sharp 2022, was also prominently mentioned.
