A brief, but interesting argument that confirmation bias is just an example of applying an informative prior. This is an argument that has been made before and one that I have been thinking about a lot. There's a lot more that could be said about this.

The author, Scott Alexander, makes several other observations using informative Bayesian priors as conceptual arguments, such as [Trapped Priors As A Basic Problem Of Rationality][ale2].
