Back around 1998 through about 2004, I tried my best to understand how to manage data from a micro-array experiment and how to analyze it properly. I started some web pages to describe what I was learning, but I never quite got them completed. I want to include links to those pages here. If I ever get the time and energy, I will update those pages and place them on my new website.

Here are some files that provide a general overview of the steps involved with micro-array data analysis.

+ [Bibliography][gen01]
+ [Data management][gen02]
+ [Design][gen03]
+ [Differential expression][gen04]
+ [Import][gen05]
+ [Normalization][gen06]
+ [Software][gen07]
+ [Steps][gen11]
+ [Supervised learning][gen08]
+ [Unsupervised learning][gen09]
+ [What is a microarray][gen10]

Here are some files that provide information on a specific topic.
