<div class="notes">

This blog post starts with a quote from Thomas Aquinas, "Beware the man of one book" and updates it to arguments relying on peer-reviewed studies. He spends a fair amount of time on the studies that prove/disprove the economic argument that a rise in the minimum wage leads to a rise in unemployment. There are plenty of individual studies that are contradictory on this question. There are even conflicting systematic overviews.

The author also has a related post, [The control group is out of control][ale2].
