Well, I filed this under the tage "Important statisticians" but this interview for the Oracle Research in Action podcast with Mark Hoffman is stretching that tag a bit. Mark is a colleague of mine, but much higher up organizationally and with a background much broader than just Statistics. This interview provides a summary of Mark's career path and a description of some of his current work as Chief Research Information Officer at Children's Mercy.
