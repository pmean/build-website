There's a common saying among pediatricians: children are not little adults. You can't take a drug therapy that works in adults and scale it down to a kid-sized treatment. Children are actively growing, their livers metabolize drugs differently, and they have a stage of life called puberty that most of the rest of us have long forgotten.

Likewise, pilot studies are not little clinical trials. Please take a poorly funded clinical trial and try to sneak your inadequate sample size through peer review by calling it a pilot. Pilot studies can serve one or more important purposes. Make sure you use them for what they are designed for rather than pretending they are kid-sized studies.

A pilot study has no value in and of itself. Its value is to serve the needs a full-scale clinical trial that you or one of your colleagues is expecting to run in the future.

A pilot study can help provide an estimate of that elusive standard deviation. The one that you need to nail down your sample size justification. Sometimes you can get a standard deviation from a previous study, but this often requires a difficult extrapolation from a different study run at a different part of the country with a different demographic mix of patients. It is so much nicer to get an estimate of variation from the same place where the full-scale clinical trial will be run.

There are other things that influence your sample size justification. How many of your patients will read your consent form and then decide they are better off going to the local witch doctor? How many start the study, but quit before providing any useful information? You should factor in the refusal and drop-out rates in your sample size calculation.

The pilot study can help you estimate how quickly you can recruit patients. Do you get dozens every week, or do you need to wait a full month just to get a couple of volunteers? The pilot study will help you estimate whether the study can finish before the year is over or if it will drag on past your retirement date.

A pilot study can help you test the study logistics. Can you fit in the extra testing and measuring that your trial will need into a clinic where everyone is working at DEFCON 2? Will your research team have the drugs ready to distribute in the right dosages? Will your data get entered properly into your research database? 

A pilot study can help you vet your questionnaires. Do your patients understand what you are asking and provide clear and unambiguous responses. You don't want a series of Likert scale items that look nice but the respondents are circling two numbers, leaving half of the questions blank, or writing detailed notes in the margin. 

A pilot study can help you estimate resource requirements. How much time does an interview really take? It's best to find out early if you have enough storage room for all the extra supplies your clinical trial will need? You should also find out how long it takes to prepare and mail out forty surveys before you face having to mail out four thousand surveys during the full-scale study. That interview that you plan for each patient--does it take five minutes or half an hour?

Also keep in mind that what we ask our patients to endure with a new intervention may be too much to ask. Does your proposed research provoke patients to stage a sit-down strike? For that matter, does it cause a riot among your staff? If an intervention is untractable from either side, better to find out in a ten thousand dollar pilot instead of in the middle of a million dollar clinical trial.

The pilot study can help you discover unexpected problems. What kind of unexpected find out early where "Murphy's Law" strikes. Murphy's Law states that if something can go wrong, it will go wrong. Usually it goes wrong in an unexpected way.
