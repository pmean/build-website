The Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education has a special issue on teaching reproducibility. I haven't read the whole issue, but the articles I have read are excellent. The whole issue looks great.

Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education. Teaching Reproducibility special issue (Volume 30, 2022). Available in [html format][jsd1].
