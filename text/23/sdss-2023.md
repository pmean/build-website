I want to list some of the resources mentioned at various talks during SDSS 2023.

<!---more--->

[RCloud][urb1] is a collaborative platform for large scale data analysis developed by Simon Urbanek.

[Jason Cairns][cai1] is doing work on a simple system for large scale modelling in R.

[Wainjing Ju][ju1] presented his R package ggpaintr.

[Davit Khachatryan][kha1] talked about a program that allows students to scrape data from Spotify playlists to explore various patterns associated with their favorite music artists.

[Soroush Mahoudiandehkordi][mah1] presented his R package, gwid, that analyzed SNP data from a GWAS.

Hui Shen talked about an extension of [SigClust][sig1], an R package for testing the significance of clustering results.

[Yue Zhao][zha1] talked about Regularized Multivariate Functional Principal Components Analysis (ReMFPCA). The link discusses other aspects of Dr. Zhao's research but not ReMFPCA.

One of the speakers cited [Jeffrey Heer and Michael Bostock][hee1]. Crowdsourcing Graphical Perception: Using Mechanical Turk to Assess Visualization Design, which is an extension of Cleveland and McGill, 1984.

[David Dahl][dah1] gave a talk on cargo, a package that let's you develop packages for R using [Rust][rus1].

[Lan Jiang][jia1] talked about changepointS, a package that estimates changepoints using a nonlinear S-shaped curve. A nice resource mentioned in this talk is [The Changepoint Repository][cha1], a comprehensive resource to publications and software that addresses the changepoint problem.
