I'm so busy these days that it is silly to take on anything new, but I found an opportunity for a small research grant that I might want to submit a proposal for.

<!---More--->

The details of this grant are described in an email from Dr. Page Moore, Strategic Initiatives Co-chair of the Biometrics Section of the American Statistical Association.

The ASA Biometrics Section invites applications for funding to support projects developing innovative outreach projects focused on enhancing awareness of biostatistics among quantitatively talented US students. We particularly are interested in projects that will encourage students to pursue advanced training in biostatistics. We anticipate funding up to three projects this year, with total funding of up to 3,000 -- 5,000 dollars per project. The project timelines would be from 1.5 to 2 years. All investigators are encouraged to apply. Award recipients must be an ASA member and Biometrics section member before project initiation.

A three-page application is due by December 12, 2016, and should be in the following format: Title, Objectives and Specific Aims; Background, Significance, and/or Rationale; Design and Methods; Deliverables/Products, and Budget. The following types of expenditures are allowed: supplies, domestic travel (when necessary to carry out the project), professional expertise (e.g., instructional designer or webmaster) and cost of computer time. The following types of expenditures are not allowed: secretarial/administrative personnel, tuition, foreign travel, and honoraria and travel expenses for visiting lecturers to the investigator's home institution. A project period with a start date no earlier than January 1, 2017 and an end date no later than December 31, 2018 also should be specified.

I was thinking about developing some web-based materials, Introduction to Research, that would be targeted to medical students who were embarking on their first research study. It could serve as an introduction and a bridge to those research-minded students who might want to add a graduate certificate in clinical research from our department down the road.

If I end up developing a proposal for this grant, I'll share details about it on this blog.
