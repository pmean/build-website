I'm working on a project where the researchers need a case-control
study, though they may not know that yet. I want to show them what a
case-control study gives them that would not be available with other
methods. But I need to come up with a reasonable control group for the
case-control design. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it can't be a
totally stupid control group either. This article is the classic
reference on the theoretical principles that underlie the selection of
controls in a case-control study.
