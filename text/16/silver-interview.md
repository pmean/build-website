This interview with Nate Silver was conducted shortly after his keynote
address at the 2013 Joint Statistical Meetings. I was at those meetings,
but was stuck in a class (a very good class by the way, but I still felt
stuck) on software engineering for statisticians. This article
summarizes the main points of Mr. Silver's keynote address and adds some
extra insights through an interview after the speech. The best part was
the quote at the end.

When asked that "Data science is the term of the day. Do you think there
is a difference between data science and statistics? Silver replied, "I
think data-scientist is a sexed up term for a statistician", the
reaction from the audience was for most, one of instantaneous laughter
and applause. "Statistics is a branch of science. Data scientist is
slightly redundant in some way and people shouldn't berate the term
statistician."

If Nate Silver can say something this controversial, then maybe I
shouldn't be so bashful.
