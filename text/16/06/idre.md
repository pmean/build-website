This is a wonderful site, but for some reason, it is difficult to find.
The Institute for Digital Research and Education (IDRE) at UCLA has put
together some wonderful resources on how to do simple data analyses in
R, SAS, SPSS, and Stata. The examples cover just about everything you'd
ever want to do in any of these statistical packages. If you are making
a transition from one statistical package to another, this site offers
you the opportunity to see how things are done in the package you know
well and compare it to how things are done in the package you are
learning. Of special note are the worked textbook examples from many
classic statistics textbooks.
