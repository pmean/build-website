This is a nice compilation of issues that you should be concerned. The
examples are mostly from things that interest Google, but you will find
this advice itself is useful no matter what type of data you work with.
The advice is split into three broad categories:
- technical (e.g., look
at your distributions), process (e.g., separate validation, description,
and evaluation), and communication (e.g., data analysis starts with
questions, not data or a technique).
