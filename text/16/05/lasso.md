I wrote a program in R Markdown that shows how the lasso regression
model works. It has too many pictures to be easily ported to this blog,
so I'll share a [link to a pdf
file](http://www.pmean.com/16/images/lasso.pdf) instead. You can also
find the [R Markdown code](https://github.com/pmean/understanding-lasso)
at my github repository.
