I wrote a program in R Markdown that shows how the lasso regression model works. It has too many pictures to be easily ported to this blog, so I'll share a [link to a pdf file](http://www.pmean.com/16/images/lasso.pdf) instead. You can also find the [R Markdown code](https://github.com/pmean/understanding-lasso) at my github repository.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [blog][sim2].
