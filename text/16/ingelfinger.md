The same blog that I [highlighted below](../procrastination/index.html)
had a
[commentary](http://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2015/12/18/preprints-in-clinical-research/)
about how clinicians almost never publish pre-prints of their work. This
is in contrast to other fields, most notably Astronomy, where pre-prints
are the norm. If clinicians are reluctant, the Ingelfinger rule may be
to blame.

The Ingelfinger rule refers to a policy of the New England Journal of
Medicine and many other medical journals, elucidated most clearly by a
[1969 editorial by Franz
Ingelfinger](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM196909182811208)
and re-iterated by a [1991 editorial by Marcia Angell and Jerome
Kassirer](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199111073251910). The
Ingelfinger rule states that a manuscript cannot be considered for
publication if it has appeared in print somewhere else. This policy
includes public discussion of the results at a press conference. The
journals themselves will often send out press releases about important
publications, but those press releases are subject to a news embargo,
which requests that no information about the journal article should
appear in the news media prior to the article appearing in the journal
itself.

The policy is intended to assure that any results published in the
journal represent original research. There are a lot of problems with
duplicate publication. The policy also is intended to discourage
"science by press conference." The Angell and Kassirer editorial mention
several therapies being promoted for treatments of AIDS that were
announced at press conferences and were later found to have no firm
basis.

The Ingelfinger rule has a lot of critics, and there are counter
examples in a book, "And the Band Played On, " by Randy Shilts. He notes
a time when an important medical finding about AIDS was not publicized
immediately because of the Ingelfinger rule.

> "There was a doctor from New York University who had written an

> It was science as usual, and the Journal of the American Medical

There are other examples in the book as well. It's a difficult and
dangerous trade-off, but I think the research world would be better if
clinical researchers adopted the pre-print model that Astronomers have
been using for quite some time.
