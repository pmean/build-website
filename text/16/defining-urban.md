I'm somewhat new to geocoding. One of the first things you might be
interested in, if you have geographic data, is an indicator as to
whether a certain address, zip code, or county is urban or rural. This
is actually quite a complex topic. This paper outlines some of the basic
systems to classifying a location as urban, rural, or something in
between (e.g., suburban).
