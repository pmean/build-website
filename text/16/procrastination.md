Michael Lauer, the Deputy Director for Extramural Research at the United States National Institutes for Health shows some interesting statistics on when people submit grants and shows that grants submitted earlier than the day of the deadline tend to fare slightly better in the review process. There's one gross miscalculation on this page, but the message is still interesting.
