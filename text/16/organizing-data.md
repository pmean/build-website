I have [some guidance](http://www.pmean.com/99/entry.html) on how to organize data (written back in 1999), but these guidelines are far superior. To be honest, you should use a database for anything more than half complicated, but for those simple data sets where you can use a text file or a spreadsheet, Dr. Broman's comments are very helpful.
