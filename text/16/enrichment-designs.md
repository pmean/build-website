I noticed several talks at the JSM 2016 on enrichment designs. I was only very vaguely familiar with what this meant, so I did a quick Google search. I found this very nice non-technical overview.

Robert Temple (2014) Enrichment design studies should enhance signals of effectiveness. Available in [html format][temp1].

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [blog][sim2].
