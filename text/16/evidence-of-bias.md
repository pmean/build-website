When I wrote a book about Evidence Based Medicine back in 2006
- I talked
about empirical evidence to support the use of certain research
methodologies like blinding and allocation concealment. Since that time,
many more studies have appeared
- more than you or I could easily keep
track of. Thankfully
- the folks at the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality commissioned a report to look at studies that empirically
evaluate the bias reduction of several popular approaches used in
randomized trials. These include

selection bias through randomization (sequence generation and
allocation concealment); confounding through design or analysis;
performance bias through fidelity to the protocol
- avoidance of
unintended interventions
- patient or caregiver blinding and clinician
or provider blinding; detection bias through outcome assessor and data
analyst blinding and appropriate statistical methods;
detection/performance bias through double blinding; attrition bias
through intention-to-treat analysis or other approaches to accounting
for dropouts; and reporting bias through complete reporting of all
prespecified outcomes.

The general finding was that failure to use these bias reduction
approaches tended to exaggerate treatment effects
- but the magnitude and
precision of these exaggerated effects was inconsistent.
