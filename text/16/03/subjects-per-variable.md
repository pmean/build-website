There are several rules of thumb out there about how many subjects that
you need for a multiple linear regression model. Most of these rules
look at the ratio of subjects per variable (SPV). If you have 100
subjects and 20 independent variables in your regression model, then the
SPV is 5. This article comes to the surprising conclusion that an SPV of
2 is just fine. In other words, you could have 40 subjects and 20
independent variables and still be okay. This is independent of power
considerations, by the way, but it still seems rather small to me. Read
the paper yourself and let me know what you think.
