I'm spending a fair amount of time over the next few months working with
Russ Waitman and the Greater Plains Collaborative (GPC). It's an
interesting job so far, and one of the things that I find quite
appealing about the job is the openness that permeates all of their
work.

<!---More--->

The GPC has to coordinate multiple projects across the eleven
participating sites, and they are using an open source [software program
called trac](https://trac.edgewall.org/) to keep everyone informed about
what is going well and what is not going well. so, when I started a
project looking at a case-control study, they created a ticket for me in
trac, [ticket
\#485](https://informatics.gpcnetwork.org/trac/Project/ticket/485). This
ticket is freely viewable by anyone, though you need permission to edit
it. I put in a detailed description of why I think we need a case
control study just this morning, and I expect that I'll get some
feedback from other members of the team that they'll add to the same
ticket.

I've worked with a lot of people who want to keep everything quiet until
after the work is published. I can and do respect that, but I honestly
feel that the more broadly you share your ideas about what you're
working on, the better off you are in the long run. So everything that I
have ever worked on by myself is described in detail on my web pages and
my blog. It's nice to work with others who are equally comfortable with
that approach.
