I'm so busy these days that it is silly to take on anything new, but I
found an opportunity for a small research grant that I might want to
submit a proposal for.

<!---More--->

The details of this grant are described in an email from Dr. Page Moore,
Strategic Initiatives Co-chair of the Biometrics Section of the American
Statistical Association.

> The ASA Biometrics Section invites applications for funding to support
> projects developing innovative outreach projects focused on enhancing
> awareness of biostatistics among quantitatively talented US students.
> We particularly are interested in projects that will encourage
> students to pursue advanced training in biostatistics. We anticipate
> funding up to three projects this year, with total funding of up to
> \$3,000 -- \$5,000 per project. The project timelines would be from
> 1.5-2 years. All investigators are encouraged to apply. Award
> recipients must be an ASA member and Biometrics section member before
> project initiation.
>
> A three-page application is due by December 12, 2016, and should be in
> the following format: Title, Objectives and Specific Aims; Background,
> Significance, and/or Rationale; Design and Methods;
> Deliverables/Products, and Budget. The following types of expenditures
> are allowed: supplies, domestic travel (when necessary to carry out
> the project), professional expertise (e.g., instructional designer or
> webmaster) and cost of computer time. The following types of
> expenditures are not allowed: secretarial/administrative personnel,
> tuition, foreign travel, and honoraria and travel expenses for
> visiting lecturers to the investigator's home institution. A project
> period with a start date no earlier than January 1, 2017 and an end
> date no later than December 31, 2018 also should be specified.

I was thinking about developing some web-based materials, Introduction
to Research, that would be targeted to medical students who were
embarking on their first research study. It could serve as an
introduction and a bridge to those research-minded students who might
want to add a graduate certificate in clinical research from our
department down the road.

If I end up developing a proposal for this grant, I'll share details
about it on this blog.
