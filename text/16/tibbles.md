I'm an old dog R programmer who tends to rely on features of R that were
available 10 years ago (an eternity for computers). But it's time for
this old dog to learn new tricks. One thing I need to use in my R
programs is called a "tibble" (sometimes called a "tidy tibble"). It's a
minor but important improvement on data frames and many of the newer
packages are using tibbles instead of data frames. Tibbles are available
in the package, tibble. This web page offers a nice description of the
improvements on tibbles.
