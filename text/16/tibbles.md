<div class="notes">

I'm an old dog R programmer who tends to rely on features of R that were available 10 years ago (an eternity for computers). But it's time for this old dog to learn new tricks. One thing I need to use in my R programs is called a "tibble" (sometimes called a "tidy tibble"). It's a minor but important improvement on data frames and many of the newer packages are using tibbles instead of data frames. Tibbles are available in the package, tibble. This web page offers a nice description of the improvements on tibbles.
