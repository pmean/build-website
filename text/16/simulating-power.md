In an earlier blog post, I slogged through the calculation of power for
a test of association in a two by two table. You can also approximate
power using a simulation. It is done quite easily in R, but I want to
show it in SPSS. Why? Just because.

<!---More--->

First set up a column in SPSS that represents a counter for each row. It
should go from 1 to 10,000, but for the sake of simplicity, I am only
showing the first ten rows. Now, you don't have to type the numbers 1 to
10,000. Open an Excel spreadsheet, put 1 in the top leftmost cell, 2 in
the cell beneath it, highlight both cells, and then extend down to
10,000. Import this file into SPSS.

Now, we want to compute the power of a test of association in a two by
two table where the treatment group has 200 patients and a probability
of success of 60% and the control group has 100 patients and a
probability of success of 50%. We want a one-sided test at an alpha
level of 0.05. First simulate the number of successes in the treatment
group as binomial with n=200 and p=0.6.

Next simulate the number of success in the control group as binomial
with n=100 and p=0.5.

Calculate the difference in proportions

and the standard error.

Then calculate for each row whether you exceeded the 0.95 percentile of
a standard normal distribution.

Here's what the first few rows of your simulation look like.

<U+00A0>

Now tally your results.

<U+00A0>

Hey look at that. You rejected the null hypothesis exactly 50% of the
time. That means that your power is 50%. Re run this simulation with
twice as many subjects in each group. What do you get?
