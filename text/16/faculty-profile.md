I got an email from someone at UMKC with the title, Director of
Undergraduate Research. She was

Flattery always works with me, so I took her suggestion of setting a
faculty profile that undergraduate students at UMKC could review. Here's
what I put on that profile.

> research fail to follow the proposed research protocol and how often
> is the research left unpublished?

I had to add in some "tags", so I wrote "Bayesian Statistics; patient
accrual; auditing research."

There's a place to suggest specific projects that undergraduate students
might want to help with, but I haven't filled that out yet. I made my
profile [publicly
available](https://net2.umkc.edu/intapps/ur-links/facultyname.aspx?lname=S).
Why not? The main page for undergraduate research at UMKC is
<http://www.umkc.edu/searchsite/database/index.shtml>.

I don't expect to get a flood of students knocking on my door, but you
never know.
