I received a suggestion for the [Kansas City R Users Group][kcrug] to use screen sharing tools. I am going to experiment with this a bit. Here are two tools worth trying.

<!---More--->

[Screenleap][scr1] is a web based system. The person presenting has to download a small software program but others can just joint via their web browser.

Skype has the ability to [make conference calls][sky1] and to [share your screen][sky2] during the conference call.

If I find out more about the pros and cons of these two systems, I will let you know.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [blog][sim2].
