I received a suggestion for the [Kansas City R Users
Group](https://www.meetup.com/Kansas-City-R-Users-Group/) to use screen
sharing tools. I am going to experiment with this a bit. Here are two
tools worth trying.

<!---More--->

[Screenleap](http://www.screenleap.com/) is a web based system. The
person presenting has to download a small software program but others
can just joint via their web browser.

Skype has the ability to [make conference
calls](https://www.skype.com/en/features/group-calls/) and to [share
your screen](https://www.skype.com/en/features/screen-sharing/) during
the conference call.

If I find out more about the pros and cons of these two systems, I will
let you know.
