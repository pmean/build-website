When evaluating a series of research articles, you often have to assess
the quality of the individual papers based on the type of blinding, for
example. What do you do if the paper does not discuss these items? I
have usually advocated a "no news is bad news policy." If a paper does
not mention blinding, assume that no blinding was done. It seems
reasonable, but the paper by Mhaskar et al provides empirical evidence
that sometimes authors leave out information that would strengthen the
credibility of their study. A similar paper is at
