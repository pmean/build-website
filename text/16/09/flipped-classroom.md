This article is a synthesis of a panel discussion at the 2014 Joint
Statistical Meetings on the flipped classroom. The article discusses it
solely from the perspective of Biostatistics classes, though they offer
some references for the flipped classroom in a more general setting. A
flipped classroom is a course where the traditional didactic lectures
are recorded and watched at home and the homework that would normally be
done at home is done instead in the classroom. This homework in a
Biostatistics class often takes the form of active learning in small
groups, such as critiquing published research studies or conducting
analyses on real world data sets. The key component, according to the
authors, is the in class interactions during these assignments. Students
learn from each other as they work in groups.

Now you could do active learning in a traditional course format. What a
flipped classroom does is increases the emphasis and the amount of time
spent in active learning.

The common theme of the paper is that the flipped classroom has been
successfully applied in a variety of settings. It is not a "one size
fits all" approach, but rather can be adapted to the needs of the
particular class. Some students may not like the flipped classroom
format, and you shouldn't underestimate the amount of time needed to
prepare the videotaped lectures (one rule of thumb is ten hours of work
for every hour of video). Still the student reactions and the
instructors perceptions of the flipped classroom are generally
positive.
