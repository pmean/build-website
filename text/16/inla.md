This page promotes a new approach to a broad class of models
(spatio-temporal models
- latent variable models
- mixed models) using a
fast approximation to the Bayesian solution. It runs under R and appears
to handle very large datasets. I have not had a chance to try this
- but
it looks very interesting.
