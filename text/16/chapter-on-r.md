I was asked by a colleague to write a chapter for a book he was editing,
Big Data Analysis for Bioinformatics and Biomedical Discoveries. My
chapter was "R for Big Data Analysis." It just about killed me to write
that chapter, but I got it done about nine months ago, and now the book
is out officially.

You can [find out more about the
book](https://www.crcpress.com/Big-Data-Analysis-for-Bioinformatics-and-Biomedical-Discoveries/Ye/9781498724524)
at the CRC Press website. It costs 120 which seems like a lot, but
when you average across the 16 chapters, my contribution is well worth
the 7.50 that you would pay for it.

It's also available on Amazon, where you can save three dollars off the
list price. Currently the book is ranked #1,125,290 in sales. The
Amazon page does have a nice biography of the editor, Shui Qing Ye.

I've got a picture of the cover.
