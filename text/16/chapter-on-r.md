<div class="notes">

I was asked by a colleague to write a chapter for a book he was editing, Big Data Analysis for Bioinformatics and Biomedical Discoveries. My chapter was "R for Big Data Analysis." It just about killed me to write that chapter, but I got it done about nine months ago, and now the book is out officially.

You can [find out more about the book][crc1] at the CRC Press website. It costs 120 dollars which seems like a lot, but when you average across the 16 chapters, my contribution is well worth the 7.50 that you would pay for it.

It's also available on Amazon, where you can save three dollars off the list price. Currently the book is ranked #1,125,290 in sales. The Amazon page does have a nice biography of the editor, Shui Qing Ye.
