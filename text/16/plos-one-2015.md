I reviewed a paper for PLOS One in 2014 and got a [nice
acknowledgment](../plos-one-reviewer/index.html)
- but I also reviewed a
paper for the same journal in 2015. Here's the acknowledgment for that
contribution. They're still having a bit of trouble with alphabetization
(Steve Simon should be the last "Simon" on the list
- but it's not).
Still
- it's nice to have a public record of my small
contribution.
