I have an R cheat sheet, [How Big Is Your Graph](../cheatsheets/index.html), that explains how to measure the size of various features of your graph in R. This blog post illustrates unit conversions. If you want to measure the length of a diagonal line segment in an R graph, you need to calculate the size of the plotting region in pixels, compare that to the range of the plotting region in the x and y directions, and then apply the Pythagorean Theorem.

For many applications, you need to be able to translate user coordinates to pixels or inches. Here's a simple example.

The following code was run inside a program chunk with fig.width=1.7, fig.height=1.7.

``` {r}
par(mar=c(1.9, 1.9, 0.1, 0.1), cex=0.75,
  cex.axis=0.75, xaxs="i", yaxs="i")
plot(c(-1,9), c(-1,7), type="n")
lines(x=c(0,8,8,0), y=c(0,0,6,0)) # triangle
user.range <- par("usr")[c(2,4)] -
  par("usr")[c(1,3)]
region.pct <- par("plt")[c(2,4)] - 
  par("plt")[c(1,3)]
region.px <- dev.size(units="px") * region.pct
px.per.usr <- region.px / user.range

a.px <- round(8*px.per.usr[1])
b.px <- round(6*px.per.usr[2])
c.px <- round(sqrt(a.px^2+b.px^2))

text(4, -0.5, paste("8 x =", a.px, "px"))
text(8.5, 3, paste("6 y =", b.px, "px"), srt=90)
text(4, 3.5, paste("10 diag =", c.px, "px"), srt=45)
# Note: srt=45 is just a rough guess

s1 <- paste("<<", round(user.range[1]),
  "x =", round(region.px[1]), "px >>")

s2 <- paste("<<", round(user.range[2]),
  "y =", round(region.px[2]), "px >>")

text(4, 6.5, s1)
text(-0.5, 3, s2, srt=90)
```
