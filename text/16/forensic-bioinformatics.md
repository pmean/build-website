I have not viewed this video yet
- but have attended a similar talk and
read a similar research paper by Keith Baggerly. His general message is
that large biological and genetic experiments are sometimes designed so
poorly as to invalidate the results. You can often discover these design
flaws through a careful examination of the data sets themselves and
their metadata. This process of uncovering design flaws is sometimes
called "Forensic Statistics."
