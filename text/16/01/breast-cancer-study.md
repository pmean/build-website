I'm starting a new project as an independent consultant. Normally, I
talk very little on my blog about specific projects that I work for, but
this work is for a group, the [Great Plains
Collaborative](http://www.gpcnetwork.org/) (GPC) that is open about
almost every aspect of the work they do. That's music to my ears.
Anyway, the GPC is involved with several projects and one of the ones I
might do some of my work on is the Great Plains Collaborative Breast
Cancer Study. Here is some information about this study, culled from
sources available to anyone on the Internet.

Just bit more about GPC before I talk about the study. The GPC is run
out of Kansas University Medical Center, by a group known as [Enterprise
Analytics and Medical
Informatics](http://www.kumc.edu/ea-mi/faculty-and-staff-directory.html).
That's the physical location where I'll be working.

The principal investigator for the Great Plains Collaborative Breast
Cancer Study is [Elizabeth
Chrischilles](http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/people/elizabeth-chrischilles/).
She is the director of the [Health Effectiveness Research Center
(HERCe)](http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/herce/about/index.html) at
the University of Iowa. The University of Iowa is one of the
participating centers in the Great Plains Collaborative.

A [nice summary of the
study](http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/herce/research/gpc/index.html)
and the [full protocol submitted to the
IRB](http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/herce/research/gpc/GPC%20Breast%20Cancer%20IRB%20protocol%20approved%2022%20Jul%202015.pdf)
is at the HERCe website. The preliminary goal is to demonstrate that a
combined i2b2 database of electronic health records across all the GPC
sites can provide a sampling frame that is suitable for a pilot survey
study of experiences of patients after they have been diagnosed with
breast cancer. The pilot survey itself will collect information on

> patient knowledge about breast reconstruction options, quality of life
> outcomes of bilateral mastectomy, prevalence and correlates of gene
> testing, the role of patient preferences and shared decision-making,
> and correlates of patient experiences of care coordination.

The study plans to send out 2,000 surveys and hopes for a response rate
of 50%.

One of the programmers here at GPC, Dan Connolly, who is sitting right
across from me right now, wrote a nice program using R markdown files in
R Studio to query the i2b2 database and characterize the cohort of
patients that will serve as the sampling frame for the survey. I want to
characterize this work in a future blog entry.
