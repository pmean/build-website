The sample size justification for a cluster randomized trial is messy.
It requires the use of an intra-class correlation or something similar
(the authors use the term within-cluster correlation). In a review of
300 cluster randomized trials, the authors found that in only about a
third of the trials did the authors specify the within-cluster
correlation. Even fewer compared this to the observed within-cluster
correlation observed in the data. We need to do better.
