One of the UMKC internal publications, UMatters, had a [brief article
about
Qualtrics](http://info.umkc.edu/umatters/new-online-survey-tools/). What
is Qualtrics, and why is UMKC offering it to researchers?

<!---More--->

Qualtrics is a private company located in Provo, Utah, that provides
proprietary software for conducting dynamic surveys online. Their target
markets is businesses interested in consumer research and employee
attitudes, websites interested in visitor feedback, and academic
researchers. It has security levels that are sufficiently strong by the
University of Missouri system to meet their [DCL3 security
standard](http://infosec.missouri.edu/classification/dcl3.html), their
second highest standard.

Even though UMKC has an agreement with Qualtrics, you need to pay
additional funds out of your own budget to use it ([here are the
details](https://www.umkc.edu/is/support/services/software/siteLicensed/qualtrics/index.asp)).

There is an open source product, [REDCap](http://chi.umkc.edu/redcap/),
that also conducts surveys, among other things. You may want to
investigate whether REDCap meets your needs before investing in
Qualtrics. I'm guessing that Qualtrics might have an edge on ease of use
or ability to modify surveys dynamically, but I haven't researched
either product in great detail.

There's a third product that UMKC researchers have used in the past,
Survey Monkey. It's a nice product, but doesn't have any real advantages
over REDCap.
