I've always been supportive of efforts to share data. For me, it's a bit
selfish, because I want to find interesting real world examples to use
in teaching and on my web pages. But the issue goes way beyond this, of
course. Sharing data is an ethical imperative, especially for federally
funded research or research that relies on volunteer subjects. It has
led to many important discoveries beyond the realm of the original
context in which the data was collected. In order for data sharing to be
effective, you need to embrace four guiding principles: your data needs
to findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable. This paper
highlights those principles and offers some current examples of data
sharing systems.
