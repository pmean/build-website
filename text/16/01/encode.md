The genetics research community should be lauded for the openness with
which they share research data. You can find numerous data sources that
are free and without ANY restrictions. One very good example is ENCODE,
the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements. This repository, mostly of human data,
but some mouse, fruit fly, and round worm data as well. It has data from
many different assays including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and DNase-seq. It
looks like a great teaching resource, though it does require a fairly
hefty understanding of genetics to browse through the data.
