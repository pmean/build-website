I'm an experienced R programmer trying to learn a little about SQL. One
of my good friends who lives totally in the database world (I call her
the Teradata Queen)
- shared a link to a blog post at SQLServerCentral
about using R. Microsoft is including R in its SQL Server distribution,
so this is an opportunity for a lot of interesting work combining the
data manipulation power of SQL Server with the data analysis power of R.
Anyway
- the blog post explains some of the cost and performance issues
associated with R scripts running on a SQL Server CPU.
