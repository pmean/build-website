I have not been thrilled with all of the hype and hoopla about Generative AI that is in the press and everywhere. My thoughts about this are similar to those of Corey Mohler in [this particular comic strip][ref01]. Nevertheless, there are some useful applications of this technology and I need to learn how to use them. Here's a brief summary of what I (as a total beginner in this area) know.

First, I have to say that there are some serious ethical and legal problems with at least some of these generative AI programs. I can't say it is true of all of them, but at least some of them represent a massive theft of intellectual property.

Generative AI uses a neural network to produce a sequence of words in response to a user's prompt. This neural network (and just about any neural network) needs a large amount of data for training. This data comes from scraping the Internet. 

Fine. But much of the material on the Internet is copyrighted. Worse yet, the Internet includes many resources that themselves are thefts of intellectual property.

I have to tell a silly story here. My website is in the public domain. I have to exclude direct quotes from other websites. Also, some of the images that I use from other websites are excluded. Now I don't mind if someone scrapes my Internet site and makes use of it. It may literally be an example of GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out). 

I do try to respect other copyrights for example. This includes giving credit when required for open source images. Some of what I do probably falls under the fair use provisions of copyright law. Maybe it fits under the umbrella of non-profit education. I am hardly an expert here, but if anyone wrote to me and raised an issue about copyright, I would fix the problem immediately.

Back a few years, though, I used an open source attribution license. Go ahead and use my stuff, I said, as long as you give me credit. Most people did. I have a bad joke on my website titled "How many IRB members does it take to screw in a light bulb" that has been republished with attribution on several other web sites [here is one][ref02]. But one site, an IRB newsletter, took my joke and published it as if it was their own writing. Of all the people who should be respecting intellectual property, it should be a group dedicated to ethical conduct. But no!

Now I don't care. I find it more amusing than anything. But it illustrates a point. Just because you put your content up on the Internet does not mean that everyone else has the right to use that content without restriction. 

When you publish your work on the Internet, you have the option of using a Creative Commons open source license. This is a popular choice on the Internet. There are several license options. You can require that anyone using your content has to [cite the original source][ref04]. You can require that they only use your content for [non-commercial purposes][ref05]. You can require that they use your content [only in an unmodified form][ref06] (no derivative works). 

Any one of these licenses could be seen as forbidding the use of your content in training a neural net. Well maybe not. The companies creating these generative AI models would argue that their use of your content falls under the fair use provisions of copyright law. Well, maybe, but I doubt it.

It's worse than this, though. There is lots of material on the Internet that is published with much more restrictive copyright provisions. Include phrases like "any use of this material without the express written consent of ... is prohibited." 

Even more of a problem is that there are many publishers on the Internet that are themselves great thieves of intellectual property. Can you re-use material that has already been stolen once? I hope not.

See the Appel (2023), Levy (2024), and Metz (2024) references for overviews of some of the issues.

There's a second issue about intellectual theft beyond the theft of those developing the generative AI models. You can use generative AI to create original content, but in a style or manner that is so similar to the original writer or artist that it infringes on their intellectual property. 

This is a gray area in copyright law, and many experts say that this is not a violation of copyright, but I still think this should be a concern.

Finally, you might find yourself accused of plagiarism if the content you get from a generative AI program was crafted too closely to a single source. I am unaware of any examples where this has happened, but I would encourage anyone using content from a generative AI program to run their results by a plagiarism detector before publishing it.

Peer-reviewed journals have concerns about the use of generative AI both in the publications that they have submitted and in the peer reviews themselves.

There is an "unconference" on the use of AI in scholarly works. Details are [here][ref11].
