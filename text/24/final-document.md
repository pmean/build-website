PhD Comics is satirical look at life as a graduate student. This particular comic resonated with me, so I am sharing it here. Although this comic strip is not directly about programming, it is a warning about being careful how you name your files.

P.S. I only reproduced part of the comic out of respect for the author's copyright. Click the link to read the full comic.
