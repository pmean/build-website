<div class="notes">

The Existential Comics website, written by Corey Mohler, is an exploration of major ideas in Philosophy that places famous Philosophers of the past in modern contexts to an often amusing but educational end. This particular comic uses a generic philosopher to demolish the idea that Artificial Intelligence can produce intelligent answers to Philosophical questions. If you hover over the comic with your mouse a text box appears with an additional comment, "AI is cool because they just renamed 'intelligent' to 'predicted what other people might say without really understanding any of it.'"
