Here are a few articles that I am recommending during my talk on research presentations.

<!---more--->

-   "Anyone, anyone" teacher from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Available as a [YouTube video][ste1].
    -   This is a humorous example of how NOT to give a talk. It is a scene from the movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" where the actor Ben Stein plays the role of a very boring Economics teacher. Look beyond the "Anyone, anyone" comments to notice the near total lack of variation in pitch and pacing.
-   Nic Fleming. How to give a great scientific talk. Nature Briefing, 2018-12-19. Available in [html format][fle1] or [pdf format][fle2].
    -   A nice article with a checklist of many things that can help you make a better oral presentation.
-   Peter Norvig. The Gettysburg Powerpoint Presentation, 11/19/1863. Available in [html format][nor1]
    -   Lincoln's Gettysburg address is one of the greatest orations in U.S. history. Peter Norvig takes a satirical look at what that address might have looked like if Lincoln had used Powerpoint. This is a searing indictment of the simplistic use of bullet points to summarize complex concepts.
-   Points of View: PowerPoint in the Classroom.
    -   This is a series of four articles in Cell Biology Education discussing the pros and cons of using Powerpoint in the classroom.
