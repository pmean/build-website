The commonly used examples of Bayesian data analysis will require specific distributional assumptions. These can be relaxed somewhat. But it is possible to provide a Bayesian analysis that does not have any assumptions about distributions. These are Bayesian analogs to various nonparametric tests. The dfba package in R implements a wide range of this Bayesian analyses. The authors of the package provide 14 (!) vignettes describing how and why you would use these analyses.
