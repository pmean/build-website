::: notes
Data Science Dojo is a company that provides training classes in (you guessed it!) data science. They have stored a nice collection of datasets for learning data science stored in a private github repository. The datasets are organized into beginner, intermediate, and advanced with suggestions for the type of analysis that might be appropriate.

Data Science Dojo. Datasets. Available in a [github repository][doj1].
