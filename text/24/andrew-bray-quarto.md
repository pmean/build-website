::: notes

I attended a short course, From R Markdown to Quarto, which provided a nice introduction to Quarto, a system for producing documents in a wide range of formats that integrate programming code (R, Python, and others) with output and documentation. It is a successor to RMarkdown. This web page has the slides from the talk along with supporting files and links to many resources.
