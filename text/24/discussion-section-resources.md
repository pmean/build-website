I am bringing together resources for various chapters in my book proposal. One of the chapters (chapter 15 in [one proposed outline][sim3] and section 3.7 [a different outline][sim4]) is on how to write a discussion section.

-   There is a [great quote][sim5] from Charles Darwin/Michael Shermer about the need to focus on larger ideas. 
-   My [newsletter from 2012-07][sim6] had a nice exposition on how to write a discussion section. It needs to be recast into the general structure that I intend for the book, but it is a pretty good start.
-   There is a [wonderful article][sim7] in BMC Research Methodology that I should cite.
