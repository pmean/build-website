<div class="notes">

I attended a talk where the presenter used quarto rather than RMarkdown to create their slides. I had never heard about quarto, so I did some searching. There are a lot of web pages talking about Quarto, and this one by Yihui Xie is a good one to read if you already know and love RMarkdown.
