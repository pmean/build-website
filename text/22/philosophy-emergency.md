<div class="notes">

When I teach "Clinical Research Methodology," I have to discuss the philosophical foundations of research. I am not a philosopher and have just a limited understanding of the topic. It is important enough, however, to warrant my feeble attempts to teach this. The comic strip, Existential Comics, tries to illustrate fundamental ideas of philosophy by placing famous philosophers in absurd and comical settings. This comic has an important lesson. It talks about the absurd characterizations of post-modernism by people who can't define what post-modernism is.
