I spent much of Christmas break updating files from the year [2007][si07]. This was one of my most productive years. I developed presentations on [children in research][sich], [open access][sioa], quality control, and [post-modernism versus EBM][sipo]. I applied for and received a [promotion][sipr]. I wrote over 160 web pages that year, and it took a long time to update these to the format for the new website.

This is the fifth year that I have updated (other years: [2003][si03], [2011][si11], [2015][si15], [2019][si19]). This is a total of 360 webpages updated. With over 1,700 pages in the old website, I have a lot of work left to do.

At the same time, I have been added 117 new webpages during [2021][si21].
