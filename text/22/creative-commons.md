The most commonly used open source licenses for journal articles are those developed by a volunteer organization, Creative Commons. They provide options that can insure that your work is not resold for profit, that you get proper attribution, and/or that your work cannot be modified. They also offer a public domain license, that allows any use of your work without restriction.
