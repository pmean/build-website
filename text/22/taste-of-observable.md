I was researching quarto, a successor to RMarkdown, and learned that it supports something called Observable. I have a difficult time characterizing Observable. It appears to be an extension of JavaScript tses a notebook format similar to Jupyter. It integrates nicely with existing JavaScript packages like the d3 system.  It was founded by Mike Bostock (the creator of d3) and Melogy Meckfessel. Of most interest to me is the ability to use Observalbe as a stand-alone system, which you can do using a tool called [Dataflow][obs2].
