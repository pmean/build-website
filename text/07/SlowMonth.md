After a burst of activity, my work on the weblog has slowed down quite
a bit this month. There are three reasons (excuses):

1. I have been working on making the webpages look more uniform in style.

2. I lost six hours of work because of a computer glitch.

3. I was in Maui for a full week and found that spending time at the beach was more fun than writing web pages.

I'm hoping that June will be back to normal. My general goal is to write about 10-20 weblog entries every month.
