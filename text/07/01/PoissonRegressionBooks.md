**[StATS]:** **Books that discuss Poisson regression
(created 2007-01-19).**

Someone on the [MedStats](../category/InterestingWebsites.html#MeStXx)
discussion group asked about books discussing Poisson regression. If you
want to use Poisson regression, you need an overview of the generalized
linear model. The classic reference:

-   **Generalized Linear Models.** P. McCullagh, J.A. Nelder (1983)
    London: Chapman and Hall. [\[BookFinder4U
    link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0412238500.html)

is quite old, but the book is still worth reading. More recent books
include

-   **Modelling Frequency and Count Data.** J.K. Lindsey (1995) Oxford:
    Claredon Press. [\[BookFinder4U
    link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0198523319.html) and
-   **Regression Models for Categorical and Limited Dependent
    Variables.** Scott J. Long (1997) Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage
    Publications. [\[BookFinder4U
