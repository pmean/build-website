**[StATS]:** **Do your own power and sample size
calculations (January 30, 2007)**

> Someone asked me for some power calculations and the problem was
> stated very tersely and completely.
>
> > *Alpha .05, Power 0.8. What is sample size to detect an outcome
> > difference of 20% vs 30% for an adverse event. Thank you.*
>
> Usually people have difficulty in elaborating the conditions of the
> power or sample size calculation, and I am always glad to help with
> that process. But if you already know the conditions, you can find
> very nice web sites that will do power calculations for you. One of my
> favorite sites is
>
> -   **[Java applets for power and sample
>     size](http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/)**. Russ Lenth,
>     University of Iowa. Accessed on 2007-01-30. *Each selection
>     provides a graphical interface for studying the power of one or
>     more tests. They include sliders (convertible to number-entry
>     fields) for varying parameters, and a simple provision for
>     graphing one variable against another.*

> arm of the study would be needed to achieve 80% power

> I made two assumptions

> 1.  Equal sample size in each arm of the study.
> 2.  Two-sided test.

> If either of those assumptions was incorrect, then I would have to
> rerun the calculations.

> I\'m always glad to help people by running programs like this myself,

> calculators like the one shown here are very good and very easy to
