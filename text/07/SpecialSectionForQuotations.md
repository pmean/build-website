> I\'ve just created a special section for quotations, [Category:
> Quotations](../quote/InterestingQuotes.asp), on my [topic list page
> for the weblog](../TopicList.html). Some of the quotes that were parts
> of other pages have now been pulled into their own files. This is part
> of an on-going effort to fix up the rat\'s nest that my web pages have
> turned into. I know there is a problem with organization when I myself
> can\'t seem to find a particular page that I wrote a while back.
