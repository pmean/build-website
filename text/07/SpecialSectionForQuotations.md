[Note: the organizational details of the current website differ from that described here.]

I've just created a special section for quotations (Category: Quotations), on my [topic list page for the weblog][sim3]. Some of the quotes that were parts of other pages have now been pulled into their own files. This is part of an on-going effort to fix up the rat's nest that my web pages have turned into. I know there is a problem with organization when I myself can't seem to find a particular page that I wrote a while back.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [old website][sim2].
