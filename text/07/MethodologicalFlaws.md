Someone (AK) wrote into the IRBForum asking about how the IRB should do
when they discover methodological flaws in the proposed research. If
everything else is in order (e.g., appropriate consent forms), is the
IRB still justified in asking that the flaw be fixed prior to approval
of the research.

You don\'t have to look too hard for justifying a review of a study\'s
methodology. Point \#18 of the Declaration of Helsinki reads:

> *Medical research involving human subjects should only be conducted if
> the importance of the objective outweighs the inherent risks and
> burdens to the subject. This is especially important when the human
> subjects are healthy volunteers.*

Point \#2 of the Nuremberg code reads:

> *The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the
> good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and
> not random and unnecessary in nature.*

When someone volunteers for a medical experiment, they are, at a
minimum, **sacrificing some level of convenience**. They may endure
**some additional level of pain** (such as a needlestick). Sometimes
they endure an **increase in risk** in order to be part of the research.

Why do patients volunteer under these circumstances? Some are in it
**for the money** (or the free medicine and checkups), and others are
**curious about the scientific process**. But a very common reason that
people participate in medical experiments is **altruism**. They want to
help out other people who have the same disease that they have.

If you ask someone to be part of a research study, and the study has
such a serious flaw that it produces **data that are effectively
unusable**, then you\'ve broken an **implicit contract** with that
subject and abused their good will.

That being said, **all research studies have flaws**. The perfect
research study has never been done. Even the gold standard of research,
the double-blind randomized clinical trial, has well documented
problems.

There will also be some **tension between the need for methodological
rigor and the need for patient autonomy**. For example, a study that
requires a patient to sign an informed consent form is flawed because
this study will be subject to volunteer bias. So tolerate a few existing
methodological flaws because your review process might itself introduce
even more serious methodological flaws.

Please **get this idea out of your head that your job is to fix flaws in
research studies**. You can\'t do it and you shouldn\'t do it. If you
desire to only approve research without methodological flaws, you will
be forced to reject pretty much any study that comes before your
committee.

So the question that IRBs should ask is not \"Is this study flawed?\"
but rather \"**Does this study have a fatal flaw?**\"

Other people will argue that the question is **whether the benefits of
the study outweigh the risks and burdens**. This might be true in
special cases, such as a study that requires patients to undergo a
spinal tap or a placebo surgery, but most studies involve risks and
burdens that are minimal to the extent that if the study produces
**anything of reasonable value**, it will outweigh the risks and
burdens.

I\'m sure that people will argue this point, but I believe that **the
IRB should hold up a study only if it finds a fatal flaw**. That
doesn\'t mean that you can\'t offer a suggestion (e.g., we approve this
study as it currently stands, but we\'d like you to consider using a
concealed allocation scheme as part of the research).

So what\'s a fatal flaw? There are two good standards. First, is a flaw
so serious that the research is **unlikely to be published in any peer
reviewed journal?** Alternately, you could ask whether a flaw is so
serious that it would **fail to meet the quality screen typically used
by the folks who do meta-analysis**?

Data that does not get published in the peer-reviewed literature and
data that does not get incorporated into a meta-analysis represents data
that does not produce **fruitful results**.

One final comment. IRBs already have the (at least partially deserved)
reputations of being **nitpickers**. Do you want to add an extra
dimension of nitpickiness to your review process? **Stay away from
arguments about methodological rigor unless the issue is drop-dead
important.**
