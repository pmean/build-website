**[StATS]:** **Interesting quote: One of the
naturalists\... (April 9, 2007)** [Category:
Quotations](../category/InterestingQuotes.html)

> *One of the naturalists had argued that* On the Origin of Species *was
> too theoretical, that Darwin should have just \"put his facts before
> us and let them rest.\" In response, Darwin reflected that science, to
> be of any service, required more than list making; it needed larger
> ideas that could make sense of piles of data. Otherwise, Darwin said,
> a geologist \"might as well go into a gravel-pit and count the pebbles
> and describe the colours.\" Data without generalizations are useless;
> facts without explanatory principles are meaningless.* Michael
> Shermer, Why Darwin Matters. The Case Against Intelligent Design.
> (page 1). Note: I also placed this quote in [issue \#26 of Chance
> News](http://chance.dartmouth.edu/chancewiki/index.php/Chance_News_26).
