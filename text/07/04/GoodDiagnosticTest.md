**[StATS]:** **What makes a good diagnostic test?
(April 6, 2007)**

I\'ve been invited to give a talk at the annual meeting of the [American
College of Allergy, Asthma &
Immunology](../weblog2007/%20http:/www.acaai.org/). The tentative title
of the talk is \"What makes a good diagnostic test?\" It will be part of
a plenary session and I\'ll be followed by two speakers debating the
merits of two particular diagnostic tests. I don\'t have a lot of
details at this time, but as I develop my talk, I\'ll put details here
on this weblog.

Some of the points I want to highlight:

-   Review definitions and explain the acronyms
    [SnNOut](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/sensitivity.htm) and
    [SpPIn](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/specificity.htm).
-   Five phases for the development of a medical test.
-   [Likelihood
    ratios](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/likelihood.htm) and the
    [likelihood ratio slide rule](../sliderule.asp).

I have not elaborated on the five phases of a medical test on these web
pages yet, but the details can be found in chapter 8 of the excellent
book:

-   **The Statistical Evaluation of Medical Tests for Classification and
    Prediction.** Margaret Sullivan Pepe (2003) Oxford, UK: Oxford
    University Press. [\[BookFinder4U
