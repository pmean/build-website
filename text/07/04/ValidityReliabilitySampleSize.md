**[StATS]:** **What is an adequate sample size for
establishing validity and reliability? (April 9, 2007)**

Someone from Mumbai, India wrote in asking whether a sample of 163 was
sufficiently large for a study of reliability and validity. This was for
a project that was already done, and this person was worried that
someone would complain that 163 is too small.

To demonstrate whether a sample size is adequate after the sample has
already been collected, you need only to produce confidence intervals
for your statistical estimates. There are a large number of reliability
and validity analyses at your disposal, but many of these involve the
computation of a correlation coefficient of one type or another. If your
confidence interval for those correlation coefficients is reasonably
narrow, then your sample size is adequate. If it is so wide that you
cannot make any definitive conclusions, then your sample size is
inadequate.

If, for example, you have a confidence interval for a correlation that
ranges from 0.2 to 0.9, that interval is so wide as to be meaningless.
You can eliminate the possibility of a zero correlation, of course, but
the goal of most reliability and validity studies is to establish a
strong correlation. Here you have so little data that you can not
distinguish between a very weak correlation 0.2, a moderately strong
correlation (0.5) or a very impressive correlation (0.9). Without the
actual data, I cannot compute any confidence intervals, but with 163
patients, I suspect that they are more than narrow enough to establish
an adequate sample size.
