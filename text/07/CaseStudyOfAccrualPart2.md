**[StATS]: Case study of accrual in a clinical
trial, part 2 (created 2007-10-09)**

> I received additional accrual data on a clinical trial I am
> monitoring. To review, the trial started on August 28, 2007 and will
> continue until January 31, 2008, for a total of 22 weeks. The
> researcher thinks that he might be able to get 3 patients per week
> over a 22 week trial (66 total), but he is very confident that he
> would get at least 2 patients per week (44 total). The confidence in
> the estimate of 3 patients per week was rated as 5 on a 10 point
> scale. After one week, a single patient has entered the study. No
> patients enter on weeks 2, 3, or 4. On week 5, three patients enter
> the study. On week 6, one more patient enters for a total of 5
> patients.
>
> What would the estimated accrual look like after each week of the
> study? For each graph, I will include a red line that shows what an
> accrual rate of 3 patients per week would look like and a blue line
> that shows what an accrual rate of 2 patients per week would look
> like. Let\'s start with uncertainty as reflected during the initial
> planning phase.

> This is the prior estimate of final sample size. It is centered around
> 66, but there is substantial uncertainty about the final sample size.
> The 95% probability limits for the predicted sample size range from 42
> to 95. Note that the pessimistic line in blue corresponds roughly to
> the lower limit of the predicted final sample size.

> After a fourth week of no activity, the medina predicted sample size

> the projection of the pessimistic rate of two per week.

> In week 6, with only one additional patient, the median predicted
> sample size declines again. If you compare this graph to the graph
> showing the uncertainty in predicted sample size prior to the start of
> the study, there is an important feature beyond the downward shift in
> the median predicted sample size. Notice that the 95% probability
> limits had a total width of 52 at the start of the study and only 32
> after 6 weeks. As more time elapses and you gain more experience with
> understanding exactly how fast or slow patients accrue, you get more
> precision in your prediction about the final sample size.
