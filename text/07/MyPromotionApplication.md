In previous weblog entries (see below), I discussed the process for applying for a promotion to Full Professor. Yesterday, I turned in a completed a promotion application. I printed PDFs of the application in six separate files and am including them here to offer additional information for the external scholars who will be evaluating me.

1.  [PromotionFormsCoversheet.pdf][sim3] includes the coverpage for the promotion package and a checklist.
2.  [PromotionFormsPersonalInformation.pdf][sim4] provides very brief information about myself.
3.  [PromotionFormsSelfAssessment.pdf][sim5] is a two page narrative summary of my contributions to teaching, service, and research.
4.  [PromotionFormsTeaching.pdf][sim6] provides detailed information about my teaching contributions.
5.  [PromotionFormsService.pdf][sim7] provides detailed information about my service contributions.
6.  [PromotionFormsResearch.pdf][sim8] provides detailed information about my research contributions.

I am still developing a list of external scholars who will review this application.
