> I was talking about a project with a fellow in Emergency Medicine and
> during the discussion realized a different way of looking at accrual
> in a clinical trial. She plans to look how accurately EKGs are read by
> physicians in the Emergency Room. I showed her some of the work that
> Byron Gajewski and I had done on planning and monitoring accrual
> rates. She pointed at that accrual was not a problem here in that the
> number of EKGs that are processed in the ER is known with very high
> precision. The problem, of course, is that the physicians who
> participate in the study have to fill out a small amount of additional
> paperwork for the research. While this is not an intrusive amount of
> work and she is going to work hard to promote this research project,
> there will some physicians at some times who will not fill out the
> extra research paperwork, or will fill it out so incompletely as to
> make the EKG unusable in the research. The ER is a busy and hectic
> place and it is difficult to get complete data, even when the ER
> doctors are trying their best to help with the research.
