**[StATS]: Accrual grant, Round 3 (Created
2007-08-21)**

> Last year, I applied for a Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute
> (KCALSI) Research Development grant. It was not funded, but a
> subsequent grant that I submitted to the Katherine B. Richardson
> foundation was funded. Both grants are rather small, intended as seed
> money to encourage development of a larger scale project which might
> attract funding from the NIH or a large foundation.
>
> I want to revise the KCALSI grant and re-submit it for the 2007 cycle.
> The KCALSI website has [guidelines for this grant (Microsoft Word
> format)](http://www.kclifesciences.org/KCALSIContent/File/KGKCALSI%20RFP%20DGS%2007.doc).
> I have a [PDF version of the 2006 KCALSI
> grant](../00files/AccrualProblemsKcalsi12.pdf) and a [PDF version of
> the 2006 KBR grant](../00files/KBR09a.pdf).
>
> This year, I want to emphasize the value of careful planning\--if
> researchers overpromise and underdeliver on the time frame and number
> of patients, they will lose credibility with the sources that fund
> their research. The work proposed for this grant will include
> extensions of the Bayesian framework to non-uniform accrual rates, to
> rates from more complex probability distributions, and accrual in a
> multi-center clinical trial. I also want to get some additional
> baseline data on the frequency with which clinical trials end late and
> end with fewer patients than originally promised.
