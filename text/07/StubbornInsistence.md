The patients who volunteer for a randomized trial are sacrificing a
great deal of autonomy. They giving up the right to determine which drug
they get and they are ceding this authority not to an expert but to a
random device. You should not abuse that gift by asking them to
participate in a trial where they have a 50% chance of getting a
treatment that is known to be inferior. This is especially difficult
when one of the choices is a placebo. There is a hot debate about when a
placebo arm is ethically acceptable.

This debate is the sharpest when researchers have used a placebo surgery
to maintain blinding. In general, it is difficult to blind a surgical
trial. If one of the arms of your research study involves a bilateral
orchiectomy, sooner or later your patients are going to notice that
something is missing.

Sometimes you can blind the comparison between a small incision and
large incision by placing a large bandage on every patient and staining
the bandage with iodine to hide the lesser blood loss with the small
incision.

But perhaps the greatest effort to keep a surgical procedure blinded
occurred in a study of fetal cell implants as a treatment for patients
with Parkinson\'s disease. In that study, patients in the control group
underwent a surgery where holes were drilled in the skull, but no fetal
cells were inserted. There was a fury of criticisms of this trial. My
favorite critique has a wonderful title.

-   **I need a placebo like I need a hole in the head.** C Weijer. J Law
    Med Ethics 2002: 30(1); 69-72.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11905271&dopt=Abstract)

Dr. Weijer notes that this intervention required the control patients to
undergo the following:

-   placement of stereotactic equipment
-   scalp incisions
-   partial burr holes,
-   general anesthesia,
-   intravenous antibiotics, and
-   low-dose cyclosporin.

I\'m not a doctor, but I suspect that each of these steps carries a
non-trivial risk of harm. Can we ethically ask patients to suffer the
risk of harm in order to provide information with a greater degree of
scientific credibility? The answer is yes is some circumstances, but you
have to proceed cautiously. We live in a society where a few individuals
are allowed to donate a kidney to a total stranger. If someone asks to
do this, of course, you have to proceed cautiously and make them
understand what the risks of the surgery are and what the risks are of
living the rest of your life with only one kidney.

But there\'s an equally important consideration. Patients will not
volunteer for a study where one or more of the options are perceived by
them to be inferior. In the era before AZT became available (prior to
1987), AIDS was considered a death sentence. So when researchers wanted
to try to test new therapies, and insisted on a placebo arm, the
patients rebelled. They tried to subvert the intent of the trials by
doing one of two things. Some patients would get together in small
groups and would pool their medication. They would grind up all the
pills and then redistribute them. They felt that a half dose of a
promising new drug would be a better choice than a 50% chance of getting
an ineffective placebo. Other patients would take their first batch of
pills to a chemist for analysis. If they found out that they were taking
sugar pills, they would drop out and re-enroll under a different name.

You can\'t blame the patients for this behavior. They are acting in
their best interests. In fact, it was largely because of the AIDS crisis
that researchers have recognized that the placebo controlled trial is
not an absolute requirement in all research studies. There is now
general consensus that in a disease that has close to 100% morbidity or
mortality, there is no need for a control group at all. Any treatment
that is helps even a small fraction of patients to survive will stand
out clearly against a background rate of 0% survival.
