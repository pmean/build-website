**[StATS]:** **How many webpages have I written?
(September 14, 2007)**. [Category: Administrative
details](../category/AdministrativeDetails.asp)

> I wanted to get a rough count of the number of web pages that I have
> written. I wanted to include pages with the htm and asp extensions and
> exclude images, pdf files, and spreadsheets. I have multiple
> directories so it is easiest to count the pages in each directory and
> then add them up.

> There are 1,252 pages by this count. In other counts, I have gotten
> over 1,400 pages, but this includes some bookkeeping pages that should
> not count in the overall total.
>
> There are some obsolete pages and pages that I plan to fold into other
> pages. As I add new pages, I will try to place them in the weblog
> directories or in the article, book, category, definitions, or website
> directories. The other directories are being kept around so links
> won\'t get broken.
