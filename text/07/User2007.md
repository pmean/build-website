**[StATS]:** **useR! 2007 conference in Ames, Iowa
(April 6, 2007)**.

I may not be able to go to it, but the R community has an annual
meeting, useR!, that will be held this year in Ames, Iowa from August
8-10. The web site for this conference
([user2007.org](http://user2007.org/)) provides some of the details. In
addition to technical sessions, the conference will offer some nice
tutorials ([user2007.org/tutorials](http://user2007.org/tutorials/)).

Previous conferences were held in Vienna, Austria, which is a bit
further away, but also a bit more exotic.
