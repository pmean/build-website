**[StATS]:** **Who wrote the law that mandates
PowerPoint? (December 28, 2007)**.

> A recent filler item in BMJ, [The PowerPoint
> presentation](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/335/7633/1292),
> written by David Isaacs, Stephen Isaacs, and Dominic Fitzgerald,
> provided a light hearted view of the bad habits that PowerPoint
> induces in presenters. I added a comment in the Rapid Responses
> section of the website titled \"[Who wrote the law that mandates
> PowerPoint?](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/335/7633/1292#184940)\"
>
> I mention how I use a handout rather than PowerPoint for my talks. I
> don\'t have to worry about transferrring my file to a strange computer
> or how it will look at a different screen resolution. I also dispute
> the myth that it is bad for people to read your handout while you are
> talking. If you don\'t want to totally abandon PowerPoint, I suggest
> that you use a minimal number of slides, use black text on a white
> background, and use full sentences rather than a bulleted list.
