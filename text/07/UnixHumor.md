**[StATS]:** **Some UNIX humor (March 22, 2007)**

The website [www.netfunny.com](http://www.netfunny.com) has a lot of
computer humor. Here\'s one that caught my eye because I am taking a
class in Bioinformatics and am learning a lot about UNIX.

`MERRY CHRISTMAS      better !pout    !cry   better watchout   lpr why   santa claus <north pole   >town      cat /etc/passwd   >list   ncheck list   ncheck list   cat list   |   grep naughty    >nogiftlist   cat list   |   grep nice    >giftlist   santa claus <north pole   >town      who   |   grep sleeping   who   |   grep awake   who   |   grep bad ||      good   for (goodness sake) { be good }`

I\'ve included links to some Wikpedia entries that document the
particular Unix features that this joke highlights. Wikipedia also has a
[list of common Unix
commands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unix_programs). Note that
the underlined hyperlinks make some of the symbols harder to read
(sorry!). You can find this joke at
