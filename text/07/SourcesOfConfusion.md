I presented a training class:

-   [Stats \#18: Quality Control: A Hands-On
    Workshop](../training/hand18.asp)

for the American Society for Andrology. The major emphasis was on the
computation of control charts. It\'s always interesting to see how this
material goes over. This group was somewhat math-phobic, and felt a
certain level of discomfort with the required exercises. Several points
of confusion involved

-   how to calculate standard deviations with a calculator that does not
    have a memory,
-   some of the data was presented as proportions and some of it was
    presented as percentages,
-   the definition of \"n\" in the P chart\--it is the denominator of
    the proportions rather than the number of proportions.

You can\'t expect a class like this to go perfectly, but I will try to
pay closer attention to these issues the next time I teach this class.
