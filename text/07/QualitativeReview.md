> -   *Degree to which substantive and formal theory is produced and the
>     degree of development of such theory,*
> -   *Novelty of the claims made from the theory,*
> -   *Consistency of the theoretical claims with the empirical data
>     collected,*
> -   *Credibility of the account to those studied and to readers,*
> -   *Extent to which the description of the culture of the setting
>     provides a basis for competent performance in the culture
>     studied,*
> -   *Extent to which the findings are transferable to other settings,*
> -   *Reflexivity of the account\-\--that is, the degree to which the
>     effects of the research strategies on the findings are assessed or
>     the amount of information about the research process that is
>     provided to readers.*

> -   Triangulation. I have seen this term used narrowly to represent a
>     series of research studies that alternate between qualitative and
>     quantitative research, with each quantitative study building on
>     the knowledge of the previous qualitative study and each
>     qualitative study building on the knowledge of the previous
>     quantitative study. The authors of this paper take a broader
>     perspective. Triangulation is the use of multiple methods of data
>     collection or the use of multiple sources of data.
> -   Respondent validation. If a qualitative researcher really made a
>     hash of things, the people best able to point this out would be
>     the participants whose interviews and comments served as the raw
>     data for the qualitative data analysis. So you can validate a
>     qualitative analysis by showing a summary of the qualitative study
>     to the original sample and recording their comments and opinions
>     about the summary using the same qualitative analysis tools.
> -   Transparency. If you provide clarity in the process by which
>     various themes have been identified and developed, your reader
>     should be able to make informed judgments about the extent to
>     which your work was influenced by personal biases.
> -   Reflexivity. This is a term that the authors use without a good
>     definition. One source defines it as an "*awareness of the
>     researcher's contribution to the construction of meanings
>     throughout the research process, and an acknowledgment of the
>     impossibility of remaining 'outside of' one's subject matter
>     while conducting research.*" When you are documenting your
>     qualitative research study, you should therefore define your own
>     prior assumptions and experience.
> -   Attention to negative data. The authors also define this as
>     deviant case analysis. If you develop a theme in a qualitative
>     research study, there will be some raw data that supports this
>     theme and some that undermines this theme. By giving extra
>     attention to the non-supportive data and trying to reconcile it
>     with your results, you produce a produce that does a better job of
>     representing the totality of the data rather than an isolated
>     viewpoint.
> -   Fairness. Is there sufficient diversity in your sample to insure
>     that an isolated viewpoint does not predominate.

> The authors do point out that all of these criteria have limitations,
