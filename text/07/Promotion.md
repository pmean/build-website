I discussed the process that I was following to get a promotion from
Associate Professor to Full Professor. Here are the most recent
developments.

1.  I now have three external scholars who have volunteered to review my
    credentials. I have several people who have volunteered to help me
    find appropriate reviewers as well. This has been the most difficult
    part of the process, as I have to select someone with rather
    stringent requirements (Full Professor, AAMC accredited school, no
    personal or professional entanglements). Perhaps this is a sign that
    I should \"network\" more aggressively. I need to have a final list
    of external scholars by October 1. Credentials will be mailed out to
    the external scholars on or around October 16.
2.  I have a new paper which has been tentatively accepted in Statistics
    in Medicine. This is good news, as most of my work has been
    published in medical journals and a good publication in a
    well-respected Statistics journal will help broaden and strengthen
    my research record.
3.  I also have taught a dizzying number of short courses and classes
    and I\'m trying to get an accurate list of these. My teaching
    efforts are quite diffuse and do not fit well into the traditional
    academic teaching mold.
4.  Pulling together the promotion materials has also made me realize
    that my [resume on the web](../00/resume.html) is outdated. I need
    to update this page.
