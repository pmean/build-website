I wanted to search for any recent references about teaching Bayesian statistics. The American Statistical Association has a nice resource for its members, the Current Index to Statistics (CIS). I ran a search for bayes%+teach% in the Keyword/Title field and found 61 references. Notice that CIS uses the % symbol as a wildcard rather than the * symbol.

It took a bit of effort to turn the output from CIS into a form that was readable by my web editor, FrontPage. I had to use some regular expressions to clean up some of the line breaks. It was a reversal of the process described in

+ [Stats: Using regular expressions to insert line breaks][sim3]

The CIS allows you to combine searches using boolean operators (AND, OR), but I could not get this to work properly. I also wanted to review any article with the word Bayes published in 2005 or later. There is a separate filed for restricting the year of the search. This produced over 600 articles, most of which did not appear to be pedagogical.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [original website][sim2].
