Sir Roy Meadow is an expert on child abuse, having published a landmark
paper in 1977 on a condition known as Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. An
observation of his

> "one sudden infant death in a family is a tragedy, two is suspicious
> and three is murder, unless proven otherwise."

became knows as "Meadow's Law".

In testimony at the trial of a woman, Sally Clark, who had two children
who died from SIDS, Sir Meadow tried to quantify this statement by
arguing that the chances of observing two SIDS deaths would be 73
million to one. He arrived at this figure by squaring the probability of
one SIDS death (8.5 thousand to one). Sally Clark was convicted of
murder, but her conviction was overturned on appeal.

Dr. Meadow's testimony came under criticism, because squaring the
probability only makes sense under independence. If there are genetic or
environmental risk factors that influence SIDS deaths, then the
probability estimate could be wrong. Not just wrong, but spectacularly
wrong. It's an error that (hopefully) no statistician would make, but
Dr. Meadow is not a statistician.

The General Medical Council reviewed this case and found Dr. Meadow to
be guilty of serious professional misconduct and erased his name from
the medical register. This action, which would prevent Dr. Meadow from
practicing medicine, was still largely symbolic since Dr. Meadow is
currently retired from medical practice.

Dr. Meadows appealed this decision in the British Courts which ruled
that the actions of the General Medical Council should be overturned
because expert witnesses will refuse to testify if they believe that
their testimony, if shown later to be invalid, could lead to sanctions.

There is a wealth of news reports on the original trial and the
follow-up. Here are just a few of the links that I uncovered:
