**[StATS]:** **Educational and networking
opportunities for statisticians in the Kansas City area (October 4,
2007)**

There are three groups that offer seminars, training classes and
informal networking opportunities for statisticians in the Kansas City
area.

The Kansas University Medical Center has a Center for Biostatistics &
Advanced Informatics that offers a monthly journal club and semi-regular
research seminars about Statistics. The main page describing these
activities is

The UMKC Department of Mathematics and Statistics also has a regular
seminar series, though some of these talks are mathematical rather than
statistical. The current web page is out of date, but you can look at
the titles of some of the past seminars to get a feel for the topics
covered.

The Kansas/Western Missouri chapter of the American Statistical
Association holds 2-3 meetings per year, typically in the evening.
Again, the web page for this group is out of date, but offers some ideas
about the general topics.
