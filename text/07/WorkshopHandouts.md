I am in charge of a workshop for the [American Society for
Andrology](http://www.andrologysociety.com/) for their [32nd Annual
Conference](http://www.andrologysociety.com/meetings/709/default.aspx)
in Tampa Florida. This society holds a laboratory workshop every year,
and this year, it is being split into two workshops:

-   Sperm Morphology -A Hands-On Workshop, from 8am to 11:30am, and
-   Quality Control -A Hands-On Workshop, from 1:30pm to 4:30pm.

I will be teaching the afternoon workshop along with Dr. Steven
Schrader. Some brief details about both classes are on the web:

-   a [preliminary
    schedule](http://www.andrologysociety.com/meetings/709/labworkshop.aspx),
-   a [flier in PDF
    format](http://www.andrologysociety.com/meetings/709/labworkshop.pdf),
    and
-   a [brochure in PDF
    format](http://www.andrologysociety.com/meetings/709/alwbrochure.pdf).

These handouts are consolidated in a single web page and an abbreviated
version will be included in the packet that students receive

-   [Stats \#18: Quality Control: A Hands-On
    Workshop](../training/hand18.asp)
-   [Stats \#18: Quality Control: A Hands-On Workshop (condensed
    version)](../training/hand18condensed.asp)

Here is a description of the handouts that I will use and the topics I
will cover. I always start by reminding people that they can find my
class handouts on the web and that I don't use PowerPoint.

-   [Stats: About this handout](../training/extras/brief.htm)

Then I will put a brief plug in for my book.

-   Stats: Information about my book, Statistical Evidence in Medical
    Trials

I have some practice exercises that involves toys. These exercises will
be done throughout the class,:

-   [Stats \#18: Practice
    exercise](../training/exercises/exercises18.htm)

You may be skeptical about quality control as a bunch of busy bodies and
outsiders who don't understand the unique nature of your work. I want
to discuss this in some detail and point out that some of the best ideas
for innovation come from unexpected areas.

-   [Stats: A plea for open mindedness (November
    2, 2006)](http://www.pmean.com/weblog2006/OpenMindedness.asp)

Then I will introduce some brief definitions

-   [Stats: What is a control
    chart?](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/ControlChart.htm)
-   [Stats: What is a special cause of
    variation?](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/SpecialCause.htm)
-   [Stats: What is a common cause of
    variation?](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/CommonCause.htm)

I will also include one of my statistical koans that discusses the
importance of establishing process control.

-   [Stats: Koan 06, The Busy Tailor](../koans/BusyTailor.asp)

Then I will show some of the actual calculation for an XBAR-S control
chart

-   [Stats: Calculating an XBAR-S control chart (March
    2, 2007)](XbarSControlChart.asp)

This handout has some work for people to do on their own, and answers
will also be available for anyone who needs it.

-   [Stats: Calculating an XBAR-S control chart, answers to "on your
    own" exercise (March 2, 2007)](XbarSControlChartAnswers.html)

The best part of this class will be the presentation of material on
Analysis of Means (ANOM). I am still developing and refining this
material, but here is what I have so far.

-   [Stats: When is a control chart not a control chart? (February
    6, 2007)](AnomExample.html)
-   [Stats: Analysis of Means calculations (March
    2, 2007)](AnomCalculations.html)

If there is time, I want to present a Fishbone diagram and let people
develop their own Fishbone diagrams.

-   [Stats: Examples of a fishbone diagram (March
    24, 2006)](http://www.pmean.com/weblog2006/FishboneDiagram.asp)

During one of the breaks, I will offer to review how to do some simple
statistical calculations using a pocket calculator.

-   [Stats: Using a pocket calculator to compute a standard deviation
    (March 1, 2007)](PocketCalculator.asp)

Since Steve Schrader is teaching this class with me, he will cover some
of this material and may have a different spin and an alternative
perspective. He does a very good job of describing the actual use of
quality control in a laboratory setting and can offer some practical
insights about how to use control charts.
