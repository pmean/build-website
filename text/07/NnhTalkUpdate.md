Last year, I gave a talk for PharmaIQ about continuous monitoring of the number needed to harm. I want to update this talk for a second audience in December. Here's the London talk:

+ Stats #71: Control charts for continuous monitoring of the number needed to harm. [Here][sim3] and [here][sim4]


Some more posts about the upcoming talks are [here][sim5] and [here][sim6]

I have some newer material

+ [Stats: Tracking adverse events during kidney biopsy, Part 2 (April 5, 2007)][sim7]

as well as a second unpublished example. I also want to provide some R code to produce the graphs shown in these examples.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [old website][sim2].
