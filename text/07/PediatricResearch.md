**[StATS]: What makes pediatric research different?
(created 2007-08-29)**

I may be asked to give a repeat performance of [Stats \#53: Signal
Detection Strategies for Paediatric Treatments.](../training/hand53.asp)
This is a three hour class that I gave last year in London. A different
group is interested in pretty much the same topic. Looking at the title
and abstract, I am a bit uncomfortable with it, so here\'s an
alternative.

Some possible titles are

-   What makes pediatric research different? or
-   Assessing the safety of pediatric treatments

I\'ll work with the group that is inviting me to see what they like. An
abstract of the talk could be something like:

**Content:**  Assessing the safety of medical treatments for children
offers some unique challenges and difficulties. Although the research is
in many ways similar to adult research, there are special considerations
because of the differing physiology of children and the more stringent
regulatory reviews that these studies require. This talk will highlight
the important medical, ethical, and statistical issues that face
researchers in this area. This talk will present several case studies of
published research to encourage open discussion of these issues and
exploration of the best approaches to meet the sometimes conflicting
needs of regulators, drug companies, and ethics review boards.

**Objectives:**  In this class you will learn how to

-   understand the medical differences in children that make pediatric
    research unique.
-   be able to describe the controversies over informed consent and
    monetary compensation in pediatric studies.
-   be able to identify the unique statistical challenges associated
    with pediatric research.

**Teaching strategies:**  Didactic lectures and small group exercises.
