**[StATS]:** **Html debris copied from other
websites (created 2007-09-27)**.

> When I use cut-and-paste to get information from other webpages copied
> to other pages (respecting copyright, of course), I get some stray
> html code that clutters up my web pages. I also seem to get some of
> this clutter just by cutting-and-pasting from Microsoft Word or even
> from within Frontpage itself.
>
> One of the most common of these stray codes is \<span\>. This tag is
> used a lot with Cascading Style Sheets, two things which I have not
> bothered adding yet to my web pages. Out of morbid curiosity, I noted
> all the various \<span\> tags on my site.

> -   \<span class=\"copySubtitle-B\"\>
> -   \<span class=\"DA\"\>
> -   \<span class=\"Fn\"\>

> These tags do not directly affect the display of my webpages, so it

> Update (October 3, 2007) Another stray tag is \<font face=\"Times New
> Roman\"\>
