As part of my reorganization efforts, I am including bookmarks in some of my longer pages. Here's an example of an alphabetical list of bookmarks, which I have already used on [Category: Ask Professor Mean][sim3] and [Stats: Archive organized by category ][sim4].

I plan to add similar bookmarks to other pages when I have time.

```{}
[A]{#A} | [B]{#B} | [C]{#C} | [D]{#D} | [E]{#E} | [F]{#F} |
[G]{#G} | [H]{#H} | [I]{#I} | [J]{#J} | [K]{#K} | [L]{#L} |
[M]{#M} | [N]{#N} | [O]{#O} | [P]{#P} | [Q]{#Q} | [R]{#R} |
[S]{#S} | [T]{#T} | [U]{#U} | [V]{#V} | [W]{#W} | [X]{#X} |
[Y]{#Y} | [Z]{#Z}
```

(Update, September 19, 2006) I also can use bookmarks for my archive pages to allow rapid jumping to any month.

```{}
[December](#Dec) | 
[November](#Nov) | 
[October](#Oct) |
[September](#Sep) |
[August](#Aug) |
[July](#Jul) |
[June](#Jun) |
[May](#May) |
[April](#Apr) |
[March](#Mar) |
[February](#Feb) |
[January](#Jan)
```
