Notice to headhunters: I am not looking for a job. I am posting this resume to help with my collaborative efforts with others outside Children's Mercy Hospital.

This supplement includes information that is incomplete and less important. In many cases, I have lost the ability to track all relevant entries because I have worked with some many different researchers.

### Presentations where I am not the first author.

There is no easy way to keep track of these, as you cannot easily verify the correct titles and other bibliographic details. Those that I do list here are valid, but there are others that I have lost track of.
