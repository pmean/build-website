About three years ago, I started using longer names for my webpages. It makes it easier for me to maintain and upgrade these pages. So instead of a short name like bimodality.asp, that used a single word, or a name that used an abbreviation like mle.asp, I used two or more words strung together, such as AmbiguousDefinition.asp or AccountForDropouts.asp. At it's most extreme, I strung five words together to get AdjustingForAgeAndSex.asp. When you combine this, though, with a fairly long base address (www.childrensmercy.org), you can get a name too long to be easily inserted in email. The address

```
http://www.childrens-mercy.org/stats/weblog2007/ContinuingEducationQuestions.asp
```

for example, is 80 characters long. If an email message truncates each line at the end of 76 characters, then this address would not work properly. I've made a vow to shorten these names a bit. I've also stored new weblog entries in the 07 folder rather than the weblog2007 folder. That alone saves eight characters. Dropping the redundant http:// at the front saves another seven characters. I'd also like to investigate a shorter domain name.

In the meantime, I will try to keep the file name itself to about 15 characters if possible. For example, this file (LongPageNames.asp) is 13 characters long.
