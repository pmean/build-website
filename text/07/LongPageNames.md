> About three years ago, I started using longer names for my webpages.
> It makes it easier for me to maintain and upgrade these pages. So
> instead of a short name like bimodality.asp, that used a single word,
> or a name that used an abbreviation like mle.asp, I used two or more
> words strung together, such as AmbiguousDefinition.asp or
> AccountForDropouts.asp. At it\'s most extreme, I strung five words
> together to get AdjustingForAgeAndSex.asp. When you combine this,
> though, with a fairly long base address (www.childrensmercy.org), you
> can get a name too long to be easily inserted in email. The address
>
> <http://www.childrens-mercy.org/stats/weblog2007/ContinuingEducationQuestions.asp>
>
> for example, is 80 characters long. If an email message truncates each
> line at the end of 76 characters, then this address would not work
> properly. I\'ve made a vow to shorten these names a bit. I\'ve also
> stored new weblog entries in the 07 folder rather than the weblog2007
> folder. That alone saves eight characters. Dropping the redundant
> http:// at the front saves another seven characters. I\'d also like to
> investigate a shorter domain name.
>
> In the meantime, I will try to keep the file name itself to about 15
> characters if possible. For example, this file (LongPageNames.asp) is
> 13 characters long.
