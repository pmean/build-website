I've been invited to give a talk at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. The tentative title of the talk is "What makes a good diagnostic test?" It will be part of a plenary session and I'll be followed by two speakers debating the merits of two particular diagnostic tests. I don't have a lot of details at this time, but as I develop my talk, I'll put details here on this weblog.

Some of the points I want to highlight:

+ Review definitions and explain the acronyms SNNOut and SpPIn
+ The five phases for the development of a medical test
+ Likelihood ratios and the likelihood ratio slide rule

I have not elaborated on the five phases of a medical test on these web pages yet, but the details can be found in chapter 8 of the excellent book:

+ Margaret Sullivan Pepe. The Statistical Evaluation of Medical Tests for Classification and Prediction. (2003) Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.
