**[StATS]:** **Continuing education questions for a
talk on diagnostic tests (July 24, 2007)**

> As part of my talk to the American College of Allergy, Asthma &
> Immunology, I have been asked to present two questions related to my
> topic (Use of Diagnostic Tests for Making Clinical Decisions). These
> questions would consist of a brief clinical stem followed by four
> choices on how to manage the situation. These will be presented prior
> to my talk and then afterwards to see how effective the training is.
>
> I have not officially developed these questions yet, but obviously, I
> cannot ask questions that require medical judgment. I believe there
> are two areas I could ask questions about.
>
> First, I could find a diagnostic test described in an open source
> medical publication and state the sensitivity and specificity. Then I
> could ask questions about how well the test could rule in or rule out.
> Possibly I could ask what would happen if your practice was in an area
> where the prevalence was much lower.
>
> Second, I could find a publication that studied a diagnostic test
> using a less than ideal research design. Perhaps a study with spectrum
> bias or incomplete ascertainment with the gold standard. Then I would
> ask what the limitations of the research study are.
>
> When I get the questions written, I\'ll ask if I can publish them on
> this weblog.
