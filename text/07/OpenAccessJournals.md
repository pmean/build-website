**[StATS]:** **Seminar on Open Access Journals
(October 5, 2007)**

> I was inspired by a talk by Jim Pitman, President of the IMS, at the
> Joint Statistical Meetings in August, \"Open Access to Professional
> Information\" so when an opportunity arose for me to give a talk at
> our local Grand Rounds, I suggested a similar talk with the title
> \"Open Access Publication and its impact on research and the practice
> of medicine.\"
>
> Dr. Pitman\'s talk is summarized nicely in an IMS Bulletin article,
> which is available on the web at
>
> -   [stat-www.berkeley.edu/users/pitman/ims\_pres\_address.pdf](http://stat-www.berkeley.edu/users/pitman/ims_pres_address.pdf)
>
> He has several other valuable links on his [home
> page](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~pitman/). There is some criticism
> of the open access movement. One of the more notable articles is
>
> -   **Open access publishing: too much oxygen?**\" Aronson JK. BMJ
>     2005;330:759 (2 April), doi:10.1136/bmj.330.7494.759. [\[Full
>     text\]](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7494/759)
>     [\[PDF\]](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/330/7494/759.pdf)
>
> An [online
> supplement](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7494/759/DC1) to
> this article lists some \"advantages and disadvantages\" of open
> access, but really the advantages are so quickly qualified that the
> whole piece is quite one sided (not that one-sided is a bad thing).
>
> The talk is on October 18, so I have to hustle. I\'m going to write an
> abstract and course objectives and place it on my [training
> page](../training.asp).
