---I was inspired by a talk by Jim Pitman, President of the IMS, at theJoint Statistical Meetings in August, "Open Access to ProfessionalInformation" so when an opportunity arose for me to give a talk atour local Grand Rounds, I suggested a similar talk with the title"Open Access Publication and its impact on research and the practiceof medicine."Dr. Pitman's talk is summarized nicely in an IMS Bulletin article,which is available on the web at-   [stat-www.berkeley.edu/users/pitman/ims\_pres\_address.pdf](http://stat-www.berkeley.edu/users/pitman/ims_pres_address.pdf)He has several other valuable links on his [homepage](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~pitman/). There is some criticismof the open access movement. One of the more notable articles is-   **Open access publishing: too much oxygen?**" Aronson JK. BMJ    2005;330:759 (2 April), doi:10.1136/bmj.330.7494.759. [\[Full    text\]](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7494/759)    [\[PDF\]](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/330/7494/759.pdf)An [onlinesupplement](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7494/759/DC1) tothis article lists some "advantages and disadvantages" of openaccess, but really the advantages are so quickly qualified that thewhole piece is quite one sided (not that one-sided is a bad thing).The talk is on October 18, so I have to hustle. I'm going to write anabstract and course objectives and place it on my [trainingpage](../training.asp).
