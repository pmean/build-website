In response to educational resources in medicine that are dominated by drug company support, a  new website, [PharmedOUT][pha1], has been formed. This site is developed by Adriane Fugh-Berman and Alicia Bell and supported by money from a 2004 settlement between Warner-Lambert, a division of Pfizer, Inc., and the Attorneys General of 50 States and the District of Columbia, to settle allegations that Warner-Lambert conducted an unlawful marketing campaign for the drug NeurontinÂ® (gabapentin) that violated state consumer protection laws.

This site includes resources on conflict of interest and a range of educational efforts that are independent of drug company financing.
