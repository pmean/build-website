There are three groups that offer seminars, training classes and informal networking opportunities for statisticians in the Kansas City area.

The Kansas University Medical Center has a [Center for Biostatistics & Advanced Informatics][kum1] that offers a monthly journal club and semi-regular research seminars about Statistics.

The University of Missour-Kansas City [Department of Mathematics and Statistics][umk1] also has a regular seminar series, though some of these talks are mathematical rather than statistical. 

The [Kansas/Western Missouri chapter][asa1] of the American Statistical Association holds 2-3 meetings per year, typically in the evening. Here is a [list of officers][asa1] and a [Facebook page][asa2].
