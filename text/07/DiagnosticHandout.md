---I have been busy preparing a handout describing the basics ofdiagnostic testing (e.g., sensitivity and specificity), the medicalissues associated with these tests (e.g., the difficulty in testingfor a rare disease, the need to balance the costs of false positivesand false negatives), and applications of the likelihood ratio. I alsoshow how to use the likelihood ratio slide rule.
I'm hoping that this handout will be adopted by teachers and used fornew medical students, because this is an important topic that iseasily confused. I've set up a [special page](../diagnostic.asp) withlinks to the PDF of the handout as well as other resources. Some ofthe tables I used in the paper were laid out in a [Microsoft Excelspreadsheet](../00files/DiagnosticTables.xls).
