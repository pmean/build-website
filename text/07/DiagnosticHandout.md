**[StATS]:** **Handout for diagnostic testing
(November 6, 2007)**.

> I have been busy preparing a handout describing the basics of
> diagnostic testing (e.g., sensitivity and specificity), the medical
> issues associated with these tests (e.g., the difficulty in testing
> for a rare disease, the need to balance the costs of false positives
> and false negatives), and applications of the likelihood ratio. I also
> show how to use the likelihood ratio slide rule.
>
> I\'m hoping that this handout will be adopted by teachers and used for
> new medical students, because this is an important topic that is
> easily confused. I\'ve set up a [special page](../diagnostic.asp) with
> links to the PDF of the handout as well as other resources. Some of
> the tables I used in the paper were laid out in a [Microsoft Excel
> spreadsheet](../00files/DiagnosticTables.xls).
