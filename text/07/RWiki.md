I use R software for a lot of my complex data analyses and have written up a few web pages about various things you can do with R. It turns out that R has a Wiki site, [R Wiki][rwi1]

A Wiki is a website that is easily edited by anyone with an interest in the topic. The main page explains that the purpose of the R Wiki is "*the collaborative writing of R documentation*." The site also warns that you should check the primary documentation for R first, such as the [official manuals][cra1] and the [FAQs][cra2].

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [old website][sim2].
