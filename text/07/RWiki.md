**[StATS]:** **R Wiki (March 27, 2007)**

I use R software for a lot of my complex data analyses and have written
up a few web pages about various things you can do with R. It turns out
that R has a Wiki site, R Wiki:

-   [wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php](http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php).

A Wiki is a website that is easily edited by anyone with an interest in
the topic. The main page explains that the purpose of the R Wiki is
\"*the collaborative writing of R documentation*.\" The site also warns
that you should check the primary documentation for R first, such as the
official manuals

-   [cran.r-project.org/manuals.html](http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html)

and the FAQs

-   [cran.r-project.org/faqs.html](http://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html)
