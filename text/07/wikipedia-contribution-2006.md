I've made some minor contributions from time to time in Wikipedia, a free encyclopedia on the web edited by volunteers. My previous work was on

+ [Binomial proportion confidence interval][wik1] (September and December 2006)
+ [Sample (statistics)][wik2] (September and October 2006)
+ [Simple random sample][wik3] (October 2006)

Just last night, I made major revisions to an entry, [Biased sample](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biased_sample), that was written in a rather informal tone. I tried to use more rigorous definitions in the article. I also added a few comments today about weighting to correct for biases in sampling and deliberately biased samples.

I also wrote an entry in the Chance Wiki.

+ [The danger of providing expert witness testimony when you are not an expert][ch01]

The nice thing about Wikipedia and the Chance Wiki is that other people can edit and improve on your work. Another person was kind enough to provide additional readings for my Chance Wiki article about expert testimony.

Previous entry of mine in the Chance Wiki are

+ Chance News 23: [What can you do with 100 words?][ch02]
+ Chance News 23: [Can Google replace your doctor?][ch03]
+ Chance News 23: [Amazon's Statistically Improbable Phrases][ch04]
+ Chance News 22: [I wasn't making up data, I was imputing!][ch05]
+ Chance News 20: [A clumsy attempt at anonymization][ch06]
+ Chance News 18: [What does "unable to replicate" mean?][ch07]
+ Chance News 16: [Exponential decay in Biblical ages][ch08]
+ Chance News 16: [Use and Reliability of Internet information][ch09]
+ Chance News 14: [Single and not so carefree][ch10]
+ Chance News 12: [Can dogs sniff out cancer?][ch11]
+ Chance News 11: [Laughter in the Supreme Court][ch12]
+ Chance News 6: [Self Experimentation][ch13]
+ Chance News 4: [Racial profiling][ch14]
+ Chance News 4: [Can you get fired over the wording of a questionnaire][ch15]
