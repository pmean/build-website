**[StATS]:** **Bad calculation of annual rate of
return (March 15, 2007)**. [Category: Wiki

> The [Chance

> A 100% increase, of course, means a doubling of value. If you doubled
> in value every year for 14 consecutive years, that would correspond to
> an increase in value of 2\^14 which would convert one million dollars
> into more than 16 billion (not million) dollars. Even Hillary Clinton
> could not get that rate of return in her futures market investing.

> If the total change over 14 years was an increase in value from one
> million to fourteen million, then the annual rate would be 14 raised
> to the 1/14 power, which equals 1.207. Thus, if your investment
> increased at an annual rate of 20.7% per year, over fourteen years,
> you assets would increase in value by a factor of 14.
