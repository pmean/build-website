In some of my mathematical calculations, I end up computing an
expression that involves a number very close to one raised to a very
large power. This term can often be approximated by an exponential
function, but I can never quite remember the relationship. An example
involving compound interest may help me remember better in the future.

If you invest an amount of money A for t years at a simple interest
rate, i, the amount of money that you earn is

and if you compound the interest n times per year, the amount you earn
is

If you let n go to infinity, this term converges to

This formula is well known to people in finance and in mathematics. A
nice explanation can be found in the [Wikipedia article on compound
interest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest).

As an example of how I would use this, I had an expression of the form

What would this equal for values of s close to zero? Replace s with 1/n
to get

This is just like the compound interest formula with A=1, r=1, and t=-1.
A purist might quibble that compound interest for a negative amount of
time makes no sense, but there is indeed an interpretation for this in a
financial context. Even if there were no such interpretation, the
mathematical relationship holds anyway.

The limit as n approaches infinity (which is equivalent to the limit as
s approaches zero) is

How good is this approximation? The constant e is 2.718 and the ratio
1/e is 0.3679. For s=0.1, you get

  For s=0.01, you get

For s=0.001, you get
