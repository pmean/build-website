> I've written some code in R to present a graphical summary of a
> complex data set using biplots. I write most of the code myself using
> the singular value decomposition function (svd) in R. There are a wide
> range of techniques that can be loosely classified as biplots, such as
> principal components analysis, multidimensional scaling,
> correspondence analysis, and canonical variate analysis.

> You might consider using a biplot if you have data in a matrix with
> rows (observations) and columns (variables) and you want to examine
> relationships between observations and/or between variables. Often the
> size of the problem (the number of observations and/or the number of
> variables) does not allow a simple direct examination of the data set.
> The singular value decomposition produces linear combinations of
> observations and linear combinations of columns that represent
> dimensions of maximal variation (a formal definition of "maximal
> variation" would require matrix algebra). The biplot is a simple
> graphical display these linear combinations. The first two or three
> dimensions of maximal variation often (but not always) capture
> interesting relationships among the observations and variables in a
> data set.

> A biplot is an exploratory approach that the data mining experts would

> A nice book that describes the biplot in its many forms is:

> -   **Biplots (Monographs on Statistics and Applied Probability)**.
>     J.C. Gower and David J. Hand (1995). Chapman & Hall/CRC.
>     ISBN: 0412716305.

> I don't have this book (yet), but a quick glance using the "Search
> Inside" feature of Amazon indicates that there is a wealth of
> information about the interrelationships among the various methods.

> Two other books which discuss biplots in a lesser amount of detail are
>
> -   **A handbook of Statisticla Analyses Using R**. Brian S. Everitt,
>     Torsten Hothorn (2006). Chapman & Hall/CRC. ISBN: 1584885394, and
