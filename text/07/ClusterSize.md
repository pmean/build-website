**[StATS]:** **Variable cluster sizes and their
impact on sample size calculations (January 3, 2007)**

A recently published article in the International Journal of
Epidemiology,

-   [ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/35/5/1292](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/35/5/1292)

discusses sample size requirements for cluster randomized trials when
the size of the cluster itself varies. The authors develop an
approximation that uses the coefficient of variation (CV) of the
distribution of cluster sizes. The authors point out that in many
clinical trials, the CV of the cluster size can be large and that 0.65
is a reasonable expection. They also point out that when the CV of
cluster size is small (less than 0.23) the effect on sample size
calculations is negligible.
