**[StATS]:** **Revising my definition section
(created 2007-10-18)**.

> I have a section on definitions and it is an odd mix of things. I want
> to simplify these pages by separating examples of how to calculate a
> particular statistic from the formal definition of the statistic. This
> would make the definition shorter and sweeter in most cases. Here\'s a
> list of proposed \"how to calculate\" pages. Items with an asterisk
> represent entries where the definition already includes an example of
> how to calculate the statistic.
>
> -   How to calculate alpha.
> -   How to calculate beta.
> -   How to calculate a binomial mean and standard deviation.\*
> -   How to calculate a binomial probability.\*
> -   How to calculate a biserial correlation.\*
> -   How to calculate a conditional probability.\*
> -   How to calculate a correlation.\*
> -   How to calculate entropy.\*
> -   How to calculate a geometric mean.\*
> -   How to calculate an interquartile range.
> -   How to calculate kappa.\*
> -   How to calculate a likelihood ratio.\*
> -   How to calculate a Mann-Whitney test.\*
> -   How to calculate a mean.\*
> -   How to calculate a median.\*
> -   How to calculate a mode.\*
> -   How to calculate a normal probability.\*
> -   How to calculate the odds.\*
> -   How to calculate an odds ratio.\*
> -   How to calculate percentiles.\*
> -   How to calculate a phi coefficient.\*
> -   How to calculate a Poisson mean and standard deviation.\*
> -   How to calculate a Poisson probability.\*
> -   How to calculate a p-value.
> -   How to calculate a range.\*
> -   How to calculate a standard error.
> -   How to calculate a standard deviation.\*
> -   How to calculate a t-statistic.
> -   How to calculate a weighted mean.
>
> I\'d also like to show how to draw various graphic displays.
>
> -   How to draw a boxplot.
> -   How to draw a control chart.
> -   How to draw a mosaic plot.
> -   How to draw a stem-and-leaf diagram.
>
> Some calculations are so simple that I will keep the examples as part
> of the definition. These include:
>
> -   Negative Predictive Value
> -   Positive Predictive Value
> -   Sensitivity
> -   Specificity
>
> It may be a while before I get to this, as this is a major overhaul.
