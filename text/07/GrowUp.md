---I attended a talk by Dr. Martha Curley about parental presence duringinvasive procedures and resuscitation. Early in the talk, Dr. Curleymentioned a bell shaped curve and mentioned "the statistician in me"which was a surprising but appreciated revelation (Dr. Curley is afaculty member of the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing).I asked her about this and she said that the first time she wasintroduced to Statistics, she was apprehensive. But she learned in hercareer that if she was going to advocate changes in clinical practice,she had to bring data with her. It wouldn't be enough to just say,you should do this because I think it is a good idea. But people dochange when they are presented with the appropriate data.This was a revelation to me and made me realize that those of you whoare medical professionals cannot afford to hide behind the fictionthat Statistics is too complex to master. Such an attitude does notserve you well and diminishes your influence and authority. If youdon't get squeamish about inserting a urinary catheter, then stoppretending you will never get comfortable with a number like astandard deviation. Grow up, and learn how to do Statistics, just likeyou learned how to do other things that are difficult, but important.You'll be a better person for it.
