**[StATS]:** **Grow up and learn how to do
Statistics (November 8, 2007)**.

> I attended a talk by Dr. Martha Curley about parental presence during
> invasive procedures and resuscitation. Early in the talk, Dr. Curley
> mentioned a bell shaped curve and mentioned \"the statistician in me\"
> which was a surprising but appreciated revelation (Dr. Curley is a
> faculty member of the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing).
>
> I asked her about this and she said that the first time she was
> introduced to Statistics, she was apprehensive. But she learned in her
> career that if she was going to advocate changes in clinical practice,
> she had to bring data with her. It wouldn\'t be enough to just say,
> you should do this because I think it is a good idea. But people do
> change when they are presented with the appropriate data.
>
> This was a revelation to me and made me realize that those of you who
> are medical professionals cannot afford to hide behind the fiction
> that Statistics is too complex to master. Such an attitude does not
> serve you well and diminishes your influence and authority. If you
> don\'t get squeamish about inserting a urinary catheter, then stop
> pretending you will never get comfortable with a number like a
> standard deviation. Grow up, and learn how to do Statistics, just like
> you learned how to do other things that are difficult, but important.
> You\'ll be a better person for it.
