**[StATS]: Case study of accrual in a clinical trial
(created 2007-09-11)**

> Someone came by today with a project where he wants to monitor the
> accrual in a clinical trial. The trial started on August 28, 2007 and
> will continue until January 31, 2008, for a total of 22 weeks. He
> thinks that he might be able to get 3 patients per week over a 22 week
> trial (66 total), but he is very confident that he would get at least
> 2 patients per week (44 total). After three weeks, he has only a
> single patient, but September is a slow month. I asked him how
> confident he was on a scale of 1-10 in the possibility of getting 3
> patients per week. He told me \"5\" without much hesitation.
>
> What does a \"5\" really mean? Here\'s a graph that shows the prior
> distribution of sample sizes, assuming that the study has to end after
> 22 weeks.

> The white line represents the median accrual pattern (65 patients at
> the end of the study) and the gray region extends up and down to the
> 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles (41 and 96 patients, respectively). The red
> line represents a simple linear projection of 3 subjects per week and
> the blue line represents a more conservative linear projection of 2
> subjects per week. According to this simulation, there is a 48%
> probability that the study will recruit 66 or more patients and a 96%
> probability that it will recruit at least 44 patients.
>
> Another way of looking at this is that the coefficient of variation of
> the projected sample sizes is 21%. This means that a 21% or greater
> shortfall in sample size would occur with 16% probability and a 38%
> shortfall (1-0.79\^2) would occur with only 2.5% probability.
>
> The researcher was fairly happy with these estimates and felt they
> were consistent with his expectations. If these numbers were
> unrealistically overprecise or underprecise, we could have adjusted
> the \"5\" to a smaller or larger value.
>
> The trial started on August 28 with one patient recruited on the very
> first day. No patients, however, have been recruited since then.
> September is a slow month, according to the researcher. Although we
> could modify the accrual model to allow for slow periods, I wanted to
> simply project the results without such adjustments. If there is a
> catch-up in accrual in late September and early October, the model
> should fit just fine.

> With three weeks pretty much lost from the study, our median estimate
> of sample size for the full study is now only 46 patients. This
> reflects both the shortfall of getting 1 patient rather than 9 during
> the first three weeks, plus a modification in our estimate of how
> quickly we will accrue future patients. The model now estimates
> accrual at 2.4 patients per week on average rather than 3 patients per
> week. It would be a mistake to use the actual data (0.33 patients per
> week) because it is just based on a single value, but it would also be
> a mistake to pretend that the initial rate of 3 per week is still the
> correct value. The Bayesian model produces a nice compromise between
> these two extremes.
>
> The 19 patient shortfall (65-46) is a combination therefore of the
> existing 8 patient shortfall and the estimate that we will experience
> a shortfall of 11 patients for the remainder of the study (0.6
> shortfall per week times 19 remaining weeks).
>
> We are still not too far off from our conservative estimate of 2
> patients per week, but the goal of 3 patients per week seems a bit
> overly optimistic.
>
> I will try to update this model as the trial progresses.
