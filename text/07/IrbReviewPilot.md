*I am the new chair of the IRB at a county hospital. Many of the studies
we review are pilot studies with small samples. I have been trying to
locate criteria for the scientific review of pilot studies, but have not
found a consensus in the literature that I have seen. Is a pilot study
merely a \"dry run\" of the procedures that will be used in a later,
larger-scale study? Or, is it reasonable for the IRB to demand that the
investigator provide specific criteria for determining whether the pilot
has been a success? And, should the IRB furthermore demand that specific
hypotheses be formulated? My impression is that many investigators
declare their studies to be pilots in order to avoid more rigorous
scrutiny of their proposals.*

Professor Mean was thinking that we need more pilot studies. In
particular studies of commercial airline pilots. Pilots who fly
regularly to the Caribbean. And it is important for Professor Mean to be
on some of those flights while the data is being collected. Could you
arrange for a nice hotel suite when I arrive?

Short definition\--a pilot study is a study that offers no direct
benefits of its own, but only indirect benefits through helping the
planning of a larger scale study. Some people might quibble with that
definition, but it is a good starting point for discussion. Sometimes
people use the term \"pilot study\" when they should be using the term
\"exploratory study\" instead.

It\'s a myth that all research must have a formal hypothesis, and this
is especially true of pilot studies. I would not encourage researchers
to try to force fit a hypothesis driven research model onto a type of
research where it does not fit well.

If I were on an IRB, I would instead demand details about the larger
scale study and why that larger scale study could not proceed
effectively without information from the pilot study. An economic
argument would not fly (we\'re running a pilot because we don\'t have
enough money to run a large study), because no large scale study will
occur and no benefit will therefore accrue from the pilot study.

You might want to assess the sincerity of the researchers. Do they (or
their colleagues) really plan to do a trial ten times larger and ten
times more expensive than the pilot if the pilot is successful? I
generally dislike assessing things like sincerity because it presupposes
that you are able to look inside the soul of another human being. So I
would only apply the sincerity test if there was major evidence that
something fishy was going on.

Another important point to remember is that if the goals of a pilot
study are qualitative, then it is reasonable to use a qualitative
justification of the sample size. A common application of a pilot study
is to identify Murphy\'s Law while the stakes are still low. If
something does go wrong (especially something that would have been
easily fixable), find out before you invest fifty thousand dollars.
Typically, you would want a sample size large enough to insure that the
full spectrum of research subjects are included, because problems are
likely to occur at one end of the spectrum or the other but not both.
Purposive sampling or quota sampling can be very helpful here.

Suppose the goal of a pilot study is to establish reliability of a
measurement system prior to using it in a large scale trial. Reliability
is typically measured by some type of correlation, so just show that the
confidence interval for this correlation is reasonably
precise\--something fairly easy to do, even with a small sample size.

Note this was actually a question posted on the IRBForum by DD, but the
question was so well written that I quoted it directly.
