I need to develop some new categories. The first will discuss report cards, league tables, and other measures of hospital and individual performance. The pages I have on this topic already are scattered among various categories.

+ [Stats: Report cards (2004)][sim3]
+ [Stats: Report cards (2005)][sim4]
+ [Stats: Using APR-DRGs for risk adjustment][sim5]
+ [Stats: Resources for the use of Statistical Process Control in Healthcare][sim6]
+ [Stats: When is a control chart not a control chart?][sim7]

There may be others. I also need a category that talks about intellectual property, software patents, and related legal issues. The most recent weblog entry belongs in this category.

+ [John Murrell. 1 Guy vs. 1-Click - guy wins. Good Morning Silicon Valley][mur1]. (Link is broken) Description: Software patents are controversial, and the one patent that best illustrates this controversy is the Amazon 1-Click patent. This entry from October 17, 2007 Good Morning Silicon Valley blog traces the history of this patent and a lone individual who was able to successfully challenge this patent.

There may be others as well.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [old website][sim2].
