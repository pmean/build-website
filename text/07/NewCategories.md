---I need to develop some new categories. The first will discuss reportcards, league tables, and other measures of hospital and individualperformance. The pages I have on this topic already are scatteredamong various categories.-   [Stats: Report cards (August    27, 2004)](http://www.pmean.com/weblog2004/ReportCards.asp)-   [Stats: Report cards (February    16, 2005)](http://www.pmean.com/weblog2005/ReportCards.asp)-   [Stats: Using APR-DRGs for risk adjustment (May    24, 2006)](http://www.pmean.com/weblog2006/APRDRGs.asp)-   [Stats: Resources for the use of Statistical Process Control in    Healthcare (September    15, 2006)](http://www.pmean.com/weblog2006/SpcHealthcare.html)-   [Stats: When is a control chart not a control chart? (February    6, 2007)](AnomExample.html)-   [Stats: What I'm working on right now (March    18, 2007)](WhatImWorkingOn.html)-   [Interesting article: Comparison of hospital episode statistics    and central cardiac audit database in public reporting of    congenital heart surgery mortality (October    18, 2007)](../article/HospitalEpisodeStatistics.asp)There may be others. I also need a category that talks aboutintellectual property, software patents, and related legal issues. Themost recent weblog entry belongs in this category.-   [Interesting website: 1 Guy vs. 1-Click - guy wins (October    18, 2007)](../website/OneClickPatent.asp)There may be others as well.
