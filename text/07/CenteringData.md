**[StATS]:** **Centering the data (June 8, 2007)**

> *Dear Professor Mean, Why do we have to center the data before
> analyzing it? What would happen if we failed to center the data?*
>
> Failure to center the data is a criminal offense in most
> jurisdictions. There is a thousand dollar fine for each offense, and
> the money from these fines goes towards the Professor Mean Needs to
> Analyze His Data on a Beach research travel fund.
>
> Centering a variable is simply transforming the data by subtracting
> the mean from each value. If you had a column of data representing
> each subject\'s age and the average age was 8 years, then the centered
> data would be the actual age minus.
>
> There is no specific requirement that you center your data before
> analysis. In certain complex regression models, especially models
> involving polynomials and/or interactions, the results are often
> easier to interpret if you use centered data. Back in the old days of
> computing (the 1970\'s and 80\'s), many computers were limited and
> used single precision storage for more efficient storage and better
> computational speed. For these systems, centering the data would often
> minimize problems with rounding errors. This is rarely a concern with
> today\'s computers unless you have very extreme and unusual patterns
> in your data.
