> Centering a variable is simply transforming the data by subtracting

> There is no specific requirement that you center your data before
> analysis. In certain complex regression models, especially models
> involving polynomials and/or interactions, the results are often
> easier to interpret if you use centered data. Back in the old days of
> computing (the 1970\'s and 80\'s), many computers were limited and
> used single precision storage for more efficient storage and better
> computational speed. For these systems, centering the data would often
> minimize problems with rounding errors. This is rarely a concern with
> today\'s computers unless you have very extreme and unusual patterns
> in your data.
