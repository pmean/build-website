**[StATS]:** **My promotion application (September
5, 2007)**

In previous weblog entries (see below), I discussed the process for
applying for a promotion to Full Professor. Yesterday, I turned in a
completed a promotion application. I printed PDFs of the application in
six separate files and am including them here to offer additional
information for the external scholars who will be evaluating me.

1.  [PromotionFormsCoversheet.pdf](../00files/PromotionFormsCoversheet.pdf)
    includes the coverpage for the promotion package and a checklist.
2.  [PromotionFormsPersonalInformation.pdf](../00files/PromotionFormsPersonalInformation.pdf)
    provides very brief information about myself.
3.  [PromotionFormsSelfAssessment.pdf](../00files/PromotionFormsSelfAssessment.pdf)
    is a two page narrative summary of my contributions to teaching,
    service, and research.
4.  [PromotionFormsTeaching.pdf](../00files/PromotionFormsTeaching.pdf)
    provides detailed information about my teaching contributions.
5.  [PromotionFormsService.pdf](../00files/PromotionFormsService.pdf)
    provides detailed information about my service contributions.
6.  [PromotionFormsResearch.pdf](../00files/PromotionFormsResearch.pdf)
    provides detailed information about my research contributions.

I am still developing a list of external scholars who will review this
application.
