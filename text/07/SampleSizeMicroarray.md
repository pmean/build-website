**[StATS]:** **Justifying the sample size for a
microarray study (August 9, 2007)**

> I\'m helping out with a grant proposal that is using microarrays for
> part of the analysis. A microarray is system for quantitative
> measurement of circulating mRNA in human, animal, or plant tissue. A
> microarray will typically measure thousands or tens of thousands of
> different mRNA sequences. An important issue for this particular grant
> (and many grants involving microarray data) is how to justify the
> sample size. Here are a few references that I will use to develop such
> a justification.
