**[StATS]:** **May has been a slow month (created
2007-05-29).**

> After a burst of activity, my work on the weblog has slowed down quite
> a bit this month. There are three reasons (excuses):
>
> 1.  I have been working on making the webpages look more uniform in
>     style.
> 2.  I lost six hours of work because of a computer glitch.
> 3.  I was in Maui for a full week and found that spending time at the
>     beach was more fun than writing web pages.
>
> I\'m hoping that June will be back to normal. My general goal is to
> write about 10-20 weblog entries every month.
