**Note: a large number of people listed here have moved on.**

I get lots of questions about where to go for help with Statistics for someone outside of Children's Mercy Hospital. If you are a student or work at the University of Missouri, Kansas City (UMKC) or at Kansas University Medical Center (KUMC), there are a lot of resources you can investigate.

The UMKC [Department of Mathematics and Statistics][mat1] has five PhD level statisticians:

+ Jie Chen,
+ Mark Gamalo,
+ Kamel Rekab,
+ Xin Yan,
+ Yong Zeng,

The UMKC School of Medicine has a new department, Informatic Medicine & Personalized Health. There is no web site available yet for this department, but this group has a PhD level statistician, Jian Li, and a Masters level statistician, Aaron Bonham. The primary contact for someone looking for consulting help is Aaron Bonham (816-235-6688).

The UMKC School of Nursing also has a PhD level statistician:

+ An-Lin Cheng,

The UMKC [School of Computing and Engineering][sce1] has several PhD level computer scientists who are familiar with bioinformatics, data mining, machine learning, and/or signal processing.

At KUMC, you should contact the [KU Center for Biostatistics & Advanced Informatics][kum1]. The group consolidates the work of statisticians at the various departments at KUMC. THere is a [nice page][kum2] that list key faculty and staff members.

Currently, there are 7/8 PhD level and 7/8 Bachelors/Masters level staff members in this group. Most have a background in Statistics or in a closely related area. This website also has a nice page

+ [When You Collaborate/Consult A Biostatistician . . . What To Expect][kum3]

Additional support for research at KUMC is provided by the [General Clinical Research Center][gcr1].

I am familiar with many of the statisticians at UMKC and KUMC. They are all excellent people to work with.
