I get lots of questions about where to go for help with Statistics for
someone outside of Children\'s Mercy Hospital. If you are a student or
work at the University of Missouri, Kansas City (UMKC) or at Kansas
University Medical Center (KUMC), there are a lot of resources you can
investigate.

The UMKC [Department of Mathematics and
Statistics](http://cas.umkc.edu/math/) has five PhD level statisticians:

-   Jie Chen,

-   Mark Gamalo,
    [cas.umkc.edu/math/Faculty/Gamalo.htm](http://cas.umkc.edu/math/Faculty/Gamalo.htm)
-   Kamel Rekab,
    [cas.umkc.edu/math/Faculty/Rekab.htm](http://cas.umkc.edu/math/Faculty/Rekab.htm)
-   Xin Yan,
    [cas.umkc.edu/math/Faculty/Yan.htm](http://cas.umkc.edu/math/Faculty/Yan.htm)
-   Yong Zeng,
    [cas.umkc.edu/math/Faculty/Zeng.htm](http://cas.umkc.edu/math/Faculty/Zeng.htm)

The UMKC School of Medicine has a new department, Informatic Medicine &
Personalized Health. There is no web site available yet for this
department, but this group has a PhD level statistician, Jian Li, and a
Masters level statistician, Aaron Bonham. The primary contact for
someone looking for consulting help is Aaron Bonham (816-235-6688).

The UMKC School of Nursing also has a PhD level statistician:

-   An-Lin Cheng,
    [nursing.umkc.edu/facultydetail.cfm?Faculty\_ID=77](http://nursing.umkc.edu/facultydetail.cfm?Faculty_ID=77)

The UMKC [School of Computing and Engineering](http://www.sce.umkc.edu/)
has several PhD level computer scientists who are familiar with
bioinformatics, data mining, machine learning, and/or signal processing.

At KUMC, you should contact the [KU Center for Biostatistics & Advanced
Informatics](http://biostatistics.kumc.edu/default.aspx). The group
consolidates the work of statisticians at the various departments at
KUMC. Key staff members are listed at

-   [biostatistics.kumc.edu/adminCore.aspx](http://biostatistics.kumc.edu/adminCore.aspx)

Currently, there are 7/8 PhD level and 7/8 Bachelors/Masters level staff
members in this group. Most have a background in Statistics or in a
closely related area.

The website also has a nice page

-   [When You Collaborate/Consult A Biostatistician . . . What To
    Expect](http://biostatistics.kumc.edu/consulting.aspx)

Additional support for research at KUMC is provided by the [General
Clinical Research Center](http://gcrc.kumc.edu/index.aspx).

I am familiar with many of the statisticians at UMKC and KUMC. They are
all excellent people to work with.
