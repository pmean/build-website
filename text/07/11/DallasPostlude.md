**[StATS]:** **Postlude to my Dallas talk (November
11, 2007)**.

> I gave a talk this morning to the American College of Allergy, Asthma
> & Immunology (ACAAI). I documented my preparations for this talk on my
> webpages and wanted to share some thoughts I had during and after the
> talk.
>
> This was by far the largest audience I had ever given a talk for. I
> don\'t have an official count, but the talk was in one of those large
> ballrooms (the Texas Ballroom, both A and B!) and more than half of
> the seats lookedÂ  to be filled. It was easily more than five hundred
> people. No doubt many of the attendees were there for the other two
> speakers, but it was still flattering to have such a large group to
> talk to.
>
> In reviewing my notes prior to the talk, I found out to my dismay that
> I don\'t have a good web page outlining the five phases of testing to
> establish the validity of a diagnostic test. These five phases were
> developed by Margaret Pepe and are outlined in her book. I allude
> briefly to these five phases in a [June 15, 2007 weblog
> entry](DiagnosticTalk.html), but I need to expand on this and place it
> on its own page.
>
> I also need to elaborate on the sources of bias that can affect the
> calculation of sensitivity and specificity in a diagnostic test,
> spectrum bias, verification/workup bias, and bias caused by an
> imperfect gold standard. These are also covered briefly in the same
> weblog entry. I did mention prominently in my a talk a fourth source
> of bias, failure to blind knowledge of the diagnostic test from the
> person conducting the gold standard and vice versa. This point came up
> in the second speaker\'s talk.
>
> There were several good references given by the other speakers, which
> I need to review.
>
> I was asked about how prevalence can influence a diagnostic test, and
> although I covered this well on my webpages, I did not include an
> appropriate discussion of this on my PowerPoint slides. If I give this
> talk again, I\'ll be sure to add this to the slides.
>
> (Update: November 14, 2007) At the beginning of my talk, I briefly
> discussed my concerns with the conflict of interest requirements that
> the ACAAI and most other organizations have. I believe that a
> statement that no conflict exists needs to be an active statement that
> explicitly states whether any commercial product is mentioned, whether
> regulatory changes are advocated, and what financial ties are
> associated with companies that sell the commercial product or which
> benefit from the proposed change in regulations. The statement should
> also disclose any financial ties with competing companies. I have
> tried to put my thoughts down in a [November 12 weblog
> entry](ReformingCoi.html).
