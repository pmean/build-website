**[StATS]: NNH talk update (created 2007-11-12)**.

Last year, I gave a talk for PharmaIQ about continuous monitoring of the
number needed to harm. I want to update this talk for a second audience
in December. Here\'s the London talk:

-   [Stats \#71: Control charts for continuous monitoring of the number
    needed to harm](../12a/hand71.asp)

I have some newer material

-   [Stats: Tracking adverse events during kidney biopsy, Part 2 (April
    5, 2007)](../07/TrackingAdverseEventsPart2.html).

as well as a second unpublished example. I also want to provide some R
code to produce the graphs shown in these examples.
