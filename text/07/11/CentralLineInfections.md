> The graphs shown above require computing of date gaps or waiting

> plot the data on a log scale. When there are variations in the number

> values by prorating the workload among the date gaps.

> **Computing date gaps or waiting times**. The first graph displays the
> date gaps (also called waiting times) between successive events. The
> first event occurs on January 24, so you waited 23 days from the
> beginning of the calendar year (January 1). The second event occurs on
> February 12. There are 7 days left in January, and when you add that
> to the 12 days in February, you get a date gap of 19 days.
>
> **Two or more events on the same day**. There are actually two events
> on February 12. How do you handle two or more events on the same day?
> There are several approaches that work reasonably well. The one I like
> is to consider that an event that occurs on a given day occurs at a
> random time between 0 hours and 24 hours. We don\'t know what that
> time is, so for convenience, we set the time to 12 hours or noon. If
> there were two events on the same day, you could place both events at
> noon, but then you have a zero difference, which leads to some
> complications. Instead, place one of the events at 6 hours and the
> other at 18 hours. If three events occur on the same day, place the
> first event at 4 hours, the second at 12 hours and the third at 20
> hours. If four events occur on the same day, place the first event at
> 3 hours, the second at 9 hours, the third at 15 hours and the fourth
> at 21 hours.
>
> With two events on the same day, this approach effectively sets the
> waiting time between the two events at half a day. This seems
> intuitive enough\--the events could be separated by no more than 24
> hours and no less than 0 hours, so a good compromise is to split the
> difference. When you use this approach, the \"extra\" half day is
> effectively taken from the date gaps on either side. So the number of
> days between Jan 24 and the first event on Feb 12 is actually 18.75,
> not 19 and the number of days between the second event on Feb 12 and
> the event on Feb 15 is actually 2.75 rather than 3.

> **Computing the average date gap**. The date gaps form a telescoping

> When you compute the average date gap, this represents length of the
> time window divided by the number of events. In our case, the
> numerator is 365 and the denominator is 23 (remember that we placed a
> pseudo event at the end of the calendar year), which produces an
> average date gap of 15.9 days. If you reversed the order of the
> division, placing 23 in the numerator and 365 in the denominator, you
> would get 0.063, an estimate of the daily rate of central line
> infections. Multiply by 365 to get 23, the estimated yearly rate.

> There is a certain intuition to these calculations. Event rates and
> waiting times are inversely related. A high event rate implies a short
> waiting time between events. A low event rate implies a long waiting
> time between events.

> **Log transformation**. The date gaps are typically skewed, so I use a
> log transformation on the data. I also reverse the scaling so that
> small date gaps appears at the top of the group and large date gaps
> appear at the bottom. This orientation makes improvements in quality
> (bad events occur less frequently and with larger date gaps) appear as
> values near the bottom of the graph and declines in quality (bad
> events occur more frequently and with smaller date gaps) appear as
> values near the top of the graph.

> **Adjusting date gaps for the volume of work done**. When there is
> substantial variation in the number of patients seen or the amount of
> work done, then you can adjust the date gaps using simple linear
> interpolation. You may be more familiar with this approach as
> \"prorating\" or dividing in a proportionate fashion.

> The first event occurred on January 24. There were 593 patients days

> The second event occurred on February 12, so that gets the remainder
> of the January patient days plus a prorated proportion of the February

> Note that this is also a telescoping sum. When you add all the values
> together, you get 7,560 patient days, which is the total number of

> days or 0.9 patient years. This tells you that you accumulate a bit
> less than a full patient year between successive central line
> infections. The inverse value is 1.11. You estimate that there are

> **Placing control limits on the chart**. You can place control chart

> six consecutive points below the center line) might produce better
> results.

> The control limits can be computed using several different ways.
> Waiting times often follow an exponential distribution, and you can
> compute limits based on this distribution. Another approach is to use
> an individual value control chart (an XmR chart). The XmR chart
