**[StATS]: What, exactly, is a child? (created
2007-11-19)**.

I\'m updating a talk on research issues associated with pediatric
treatments. Before I start throwing around terms like \"paediatric\" and
\"child,\" I should take some time to note that these terms have some
ambiguity in them. A child is typically defined as a person with an age
less than 18 years. This is not a hard and fast definition, though, and
certainly I would not quibble if you used 16 years or 21 years as the
boundary between a child and an adult. There are certain activities,
such as marrying, living on one\'s own, becoming a father or mother,
that will sometimes change the status of a child in legal or social
settings.

The age range 0 to 18 years is a very broad range, and it makes sense at
times to limit the discussion to certain age subgroups. This again is an
arbitrary choice, but the International Conference on Harmonisation
offers the following categories for consideration.

-   preterm newborn infants,
-   term newborn infants (0 to 27 days),
-   infants and toddlers (28 days to 23 months),
-   children (2 to 11 years), and
-   adolescents (12 years to adult).

Other definitions of child and other categorizations of age groups may
certainly be appropriate. A lot depends on the context of the particular
research problem.
