There is a [cute video][fli1] out showing some examples of manipulating graphic images using a touchscreen interface. In particular, the operator can expand images and zoom in by stretching two fingers apart. While there are not a lot of examples of statistical graphics in this video, with a bit of imagination, you can imagine how this sort of interface might improve the analysis of large and complex data sets.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [old website][sim2].
