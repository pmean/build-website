There is a cute video out showing some examples of manipulating graphic
images using a touchscreen interface:

In particular, the operator can expand images and zoom in by stretching
two fingers apart. While there are not a lot of examples of statistical
graphics in this video, with a bit of imagination, you can imagine how
this sort of interface might improve the analysis of large and complex
data sets.
