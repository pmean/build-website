Analysis of Means (ANOM) are available for a wide range of data sets,
and it is impossible to summarize all the applications of ANOM here. The
goal on this web page is to illustrate a few of the calculations.

<!---More--->

The simplest application of ANOM is a balanced single factor study. A
single factor represents measurements done across individuals or
sometimes machines, or other conditions). Let I represent the number of
individuals being studied and let N represent the total number of
observations. If there are m observations per individual, then N=mI.

For each individual, calculate a mean and a variance. The formula for
upper and lower decision limits in this setting is

As a classroom exercise, a group of three volunteers (labeled A, R, and
V to protect their anonymity) were asked to take turns hitting a target
with a hand launched foam rocket.

Since the group was small, I asked each team member to shoot twice with
their dominant hand and twice with their non-dominant hand. For each
shot, the distance from the target was measured in centimeters. Here is
the data (D=dominant hand, N=non-dominant hand).

```{}
A-D 14 39
A-N 60 20
R-D 26  9
R-N  9 12
V-D 36 21
V-N 53 18`
```

The means, variances, and standard deviations are:

```{}
    Mean Var   Stdev
A-D 26.5 312.5 17.68
A-N 40.0 800.0 28.28
R-D 17.5 144.5 12.02
R-N 10.5   4.5  2.12
V-D 28.5 112.5 10.61
V-N 35.5 612.5 24.75
```

The overall mean is 26.42 and the pooled standard deviation is 18.20.
The ANOM limits are

```{}
26.4 - 3.724 * 18.2 * sqrt(5/12) = -17.3 (round this to zero)
26.4 + 3.724 * 18.2 * sqrt(5/12) =  70.1`
```

Here is a graph of the results:
