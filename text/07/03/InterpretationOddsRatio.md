**[StATS]:** **Interpretation of an odds ratio
(March 21, 2007)**

Someone sent me some data on crime. In a sample of 2,957,239 people, 961
were criminals. 41 of the criminals were in the first group (who
numbered 20,109). The remaining 920 were in the larger group
(2,937,130). This person computed an odds ratio of 6.5 and wondered what
it meant.Â  Does this mean that for every criminal in the larger group,
there are 6.5 criminals in the smaller group?

I had to explain that that sort of ratio would only occur if the two
groups each constituted exactly 50% of the total. What makes more sense
here is to estimate the probability of being a criminal in each group.
For the small group it is 0.2% (41/20,109) and for the larger group it
is 0.03% (920/2,937,130). The ratio of these two probabilities is 6.7
telling you that the probability is almost seven times higher in the
small group compared to the large group. Another way of looking at this
is that the smaller group represents 0.7% (20,109/2,957,239) of the
total, but are responsible for 4.5% (41/920) of the crimes. Their
contribution is approximately 6.4 times larger than you would expect.

The math works out nicely in this example because crime is a rare event.
If the proportion of crimes in either group was large (say 20% of more)
then interpretation of the odds ratio and other related ratios becomes
more difficult.
