> The fishbone diagram (also called the Ishikawa diagram, or the case
> and effect diagram) is a tool for identifying the root causes of
> quality problems. It was named after Kaoru Ishikawa, the man who
> pioneered the use of this chart in quality improvement in the 1960\'s.

> If you want to use a Fishbone Diagram, first list the main problem on
> the right hand side of the paper. Then draw a horizontal line to
> represent the \"backbone\" of the diagram. This line is not labeled.
> Off of the backbone, draw and label major bones: 4 to 7 major
> categories of causes. A commonly used list of major causes is
> Management, Manpower, Machines, and Materials. Another possible list
> is Policies, Procedures, Plant, and People. Then elicit ideas using an
> approach like brainstorming to place individual causes as minor bones
> on each major bone. Some people allow the individual causes to have
> subcauses, which would be attached to the minor bones. This is
> intended to get at the fundamental or root causes of the problem.
> Other people do not include this level of detail on their fishbone
> diagrams.
>
> When you are done, look at the entire diagram. Does it have reasonable
> balance across the major bones? Are any common themes emerging? Can
> you identify causes that are measurable and fixable and which you
> believe are likely to have a large impact on the problem?
>
> In some situations, you may find that a flow diagram of the work
> process may be more valuable and informative.

>     Diagram? A Cause-and-Effect Diagram is a tool that helps identify,
>     sort, and display possible causes of a specific problem or quality
>     characteristic (Viewgraph 1). It graphically illustrates the
>     relationship between a given outcome and all the factors that
>     influence the outcome. This type of diagram is sometimes called an
>     \"Ishikawa diagram\" because it was invented by Kaoru Ishikawa, or
>     a \"fishbone diagram\" because of the way it looks.*
