---This is a condensed version of a handout-   [Stats: Examples of a fishbone diagram (March    24, 2006)](http://www.pmean.com/weblog2006/FishboneDiagram.html)that I have used in previous training classes.The fishbone diagram (also called the Ishikawa diagram, or the caseand effect diagram) is a tool for identifying the root causes ofquality problems. It was named after Kaoru Ishikawa, the man whopioneered the use of this chart in quality improvement in the 1960's.If you want to use a Fishbone Diagram, first list the main problem onthe right hand side of the paper. Then draw a horizontal line torepresent the "backbone" of the diagram. This line is not labeled.Off of the backbone, draw and label major bones: 4 to 7 majorcategories of causes. A commonly used list of major causes isManagement, Manpower, Machines, and Materials. Another possible listis Policies, Procedures, Plant, and People. Then elicit ideas using anapproach like brainstorming to place individual causes as minor boneson each major bone. Some people allow the individual causes to havesubcauses, which would be attached to the minor bones. This isintended to get at the fundamental or root causes of the problem.Other people do not include this level of detail on their fishbonediagrams.When you are done, look at the entire diagram. Does it have reasonablebalance across the major bones? Are any common themes emerging? Canyou identify causes that are measurable and fixable and which youbelieve are likely to have a large impact on the problem?In some situations, you may find that a flow diagram of the workprocess may be more valuable and informative.**Further reading:**-   **The Memory Jogger, A Pocket Guide of Tools for Continuous    Improvement**.

A Cause-and-Effect Diagram is a tool that helps identify,    sort, and display possible causes of a specific problem or quality    characteristic (Viewgraph 1). It graphically illustrates the    relationship between a given outcome and all the factors that    influence the outcome. This type of diagram is sometimes called an    "Ishikawa diagram" because it was invented by Kaoru Ishikawa, or    a "fishbone diagram" because of the way it looks.*    www.hq.navy.mil/RBA/c-ediag.pdf.
