**[StATS]:** **Ignore weak evidence at your own
peril (created 2007-03-13)**.

I ran across an interesting article recently.

-   **Incorporating quality of evidence into decision analytic
    modeling.** R. S. Braithwaite, M. S. Roberts, A. C. Justice. Ann
    Intern Med 2007: 146(2); 133-41.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=17227937&dopt=Abstract)
    [\[Abstract\]](http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/146/2/133)

I\'m reproducing the abstract here because I find the results
intriguing.

I have not yet read the full article, but the message seems to be that
using evidence from weak data sources is better than ignoring it.
