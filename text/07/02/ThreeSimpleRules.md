**[StATS]:** **Three simple rules to establish
quality (created 2007-02-15)**.

I received a recommendation to purchase a book (Process Quality Control,
by Ellis Ott) and while searching for reviews of this book, found
something called Ott\'s Rules. These are three simple rules advocated by
Dr. Ott in any process control problem:

1.  use data,
2.  use graphs, and
3.  plot data in time sequence.

An elaboration on why these rules make sense can be found in the
[September 11, 2005
posting](http://jsdstat.com/Statblog/2005/09/11/otts-rules/) of the
[Statistical and Scientific Thinking
blog](http://www.jsdstat.com/Statblog/). While browsing this blog, I
found another interesting entry on a different blog:
