> I got a question about how to interpret an interaction term in a
> Poisson regression model. The first thing to remember is that the
> estimates in a Poisson regression model are computed using a log link
> function. When you transform them back using an anti-log, you get an
> estimate of a ratio. Sometimes it is called an incidence density
> ratio.
>
> In this particular model, there were two independent variables,
> temperature and height (2M, 22M, and 48M). Height has three levels, so
> he coded an indicator variable for the 22M category and the 48M
> category. The coefficient for temperature is 0.08, the coefficient for
> the two dummy variables are 0.38 and 0.01. This model has a separate
> interaction term for each dummy variable and temperature. These
> coefficients are both -0.03. He did not specify an intercept. Let\'s
> pretend it is 3.52.

> The temperature coefficient is positive and it shows that in the
> reference category (2M), there is an increase in count as temperature
> increases. The antilog of 0.08 is 1.08, which tells you that the
> average count increases by 8% for each unit increase in temperature in
> the 2M category. A ten unit increase would produce a relative shift in
> the average count equal to the antilog of 0.80 or 2.22. In other
> words, a ten unit shift produces more than a doubling in average count
> (again remember that this is for the reference category of 2M).

> -0.03 or 1.05. So in the other two categories, temperature has a less
> pronounced effect. It is sitll probably an important effect, though

> 75.2 (antilog of 3.52 + 10\*0.08), in the 22M group of 81.5 (antilog
> of 3.52 + 0.38 + 10\*0.05), and in the 48M group of 56.3 (antilog of
> 3.52 + 0.01 +10\*0.05). Note that at 10 degrees the 2M group no longer
> lags the 22M group by about 50%. Instead they are almost equal. Note
> that the 2M group has surpassed the 48M group at 10 degrees (they were

> It is an interesting exercise to ask where the 2M line (3.52 + 0.08 T)
> and 22M line (3.90 + 0.05 T) cross. It occurs right around 12.67. For
> temperatures at or below this value, the 22M line has a higher average
> count, but this reverses for temperatures above 12.67.

> The 2M and 48M lines also cross, but at a point very close to zero.
> For most reasonable values of temperature, 2M is better than 48M, and

> A second model had an interaction between two continuous variables,
> wind speed and rain. The coefficients for wind, rain, and the
> interaction are 0.9, -0.04, and -0.11 respectively. Wind increases the
> average count by 2.46 (antilog of 0.9) per unit increase, when rain is
> held constant at zero. A unit increase in rain leads to a 0.96
> (antilog of -0.04) relative change, assuming that wind is held
> constant at zero.
>
> The interaction is negative which means two things: the effect of wind
> is weaker when rain is positive, and the effect of rain is stronger
> (even more negative) when wind is positive.
>
> For example, the slope for wind when rain equals 5 units is 0.9 -
> 0.11\*5 = 0.45. The antilog here is 1.56 meaning a slightly more than
> 50% increase when wind increases by one unit on a day when rain equals
> 5 units. At zero, the effect was 2.46 (antilog of 0.9), a much more
> pronounced effect.
>
> The slope for rain when wind equals 10 is -0.04 - 0.11\*10 = -1.14.
> The antilog is 0.32, which means that a one unit increase in rain
> lower the average count roughly by a factor of 3. This statement is
> only true when wind equals 10. When wind equals zero, the relative
> change is 0.96 (antilog of -0.04) per unit increase in rain, which is
> hardly a change at all.
>
> An interesting exercise again is to see at what value of rain, does
> the interaction cancel out the positive slope for wind. That value is
> 8.2 (= 0.9 / 0.11). So when rain is at 8.2, the average count does not
> change as wind changes.
>
> So what\'s the general conclusion. A dry wind increases count compared
> to a dry calm, but a wet wind compared to a wet calm does so to a much
> lesser degree. Too much wetness cancel out or even reverse this
> relationship. Rain has a slightly negative impact when it is calm, but
> has an increasingly strong influence as the weather gets windier.
>
> You can get confidence intervals for all of these values, but you need
> to know both the standard error of the individual coefficients and the
> correlations among the coefficients.
