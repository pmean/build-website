I was asked to fill out a conflict of interest form for a talk I will be
giving in December. While I have not gotten any money directly from drug
companies recently, I do have some financial support outside the
hospital that might be considered a conflict of interest in some
contexts. These sources of support do not relate directly or indirectly
to the topic I will be discussing in December (or any of the topics that
I plan to discuss), but it it better to disclose too much rather than
too little. I will try to update this page as new sources of support
appear.

**Ongoing**. I have been working with Fertility Solutions, Inc. on a
study of sperm morphology classifications. The total consulting fees
through October 2008 are less than \$5,000.

**Ongoing**. I have been working with the Cleveland Chiropractic College
on a variety of research projects for pay. The total consulting fees
through October 2008 are less than \$2,000.

**Ongoing**. I received royalties (variable, total to date less than
\$3,000) from Oxford University Press from sales of my book, Statistical
Evidence in Medical Trials: What Do the Data Really Tell Us?

**November 2007**. I received a \$500 honorarium and travel support
(approximately \$600) from the American College of Allergy, Asthma &
Immunology to give a 30 minute talk in Dallas, TX at their annual
conference.

**September 2007**. I received a \$500 honorarium from the Kansas City
University of Medicine and Biosciences

**April 2007**. I received travel support (approximately \$400) from the
American Society for Andrology to give a short course in Tampa, FL at
their annual conference.

**March 2007**. I received a \$200 honorarium from the Medical Center of
Independence to give a one hour seminar for their grand rounds in
Independence, MO.

**January 2007**. I received a grant of \$3,200 from Children\'s Mercy
Hospital to study accrual problems in clinical trials.

**December 2006**. I received \$1500 in travel support from the
International Quality & Productivity Center to give a talk and short
course in London, England at their annual Data Mining and Signal
Detection conference

**October 2006**. I received a \$500 honorarium and travel support
(approximately \$400) from the Midwest Society for Pediatric Research to
give a talk in Indianapolis, IN at their annual conference.

There are additional sources of outside support prior to July 2006,
which I will try to list when I have time.
