I was reading an article in written by Steven Goodwin, [The Seven Sins
of
Programmers](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/the_seven_sins_of_programmers),
published in issue 17 of the [Free Software
Magazine](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/) and thought it would be
fun to use a similar theme in research.

So here are the seven deadly sins of researchers. Lest I be accused of
the sin of pride, let me admit that everyone, including myself has been
tempted by and has indulged in some of these sins at one point in their
research career.

**Pride**: Researchers often think they know better than anyone else how
to do research, so they ignore existing precedents in designing their
studies.

**Envy**: Researchers usually avoid replicating important studies
because their work would stand in the shadow of the first research team.

**Sloth**: Researchers will often take the easy way out, wanting to get
a quick publication rather than creating a research result that is truly
useful.

**Gluttony**: Researchers will frequently present as many tables,
graphs, and tests in a publication that they can, in the hopes that at
least one of these will end up convincing the reader that their study is
worthwhile.

**Lust**: Researchers are sometimes so desirous of showing a particular
outcome that they twist all of the available research to fit their model
of the world.

**Anger**: Researchers are usually unfairly harsh in the critiques of
other researchers whose findings that they find unwelcome or
uncomfortable.

**Greed**: Researchers will often overstate the clinical significance of
their findings in the discussion section.

I\'d like to elaborate on each of these points in later weblog entries.
