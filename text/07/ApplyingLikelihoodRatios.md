Someone sent me a nice email complimenting my likelihood ratio slide
rule.

-   [Stats: Likelihood ratio slide rule](../sliderule.asp)

He/she also pointed out a simple way to apply likelihood ratios in your
head.

That does indeed work, and I checked it out for some other examples.
Suppose the pretest probability is 50%. Thus one person has the disease
and one does not. A likelihood ratio of 4 changes this to four people
with the disease and one without or a probability of 80%.

You can also do this with a likelihood ratio for a negative test.
Suppose the pretest probability is 40% (4 with and 6 without the
disease). A negative result with a likelihood ratio of 0.25 (1/4)
changes this to 4 with and 24 without the disease. The probability
changes to 4/28 or 1/7 which is about 14%.

I appreciate feedback like this, as it reminds me that there are several
ways to tackle a problem.
