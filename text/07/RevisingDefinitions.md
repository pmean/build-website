I have a section on definitions and it is an odd mix of things. I want to simplify these pages by separating examples of how to calculate a particular statistic from the formal definition of the statistic. This would make the definition shorter and sweeter in most cases. Here's a list of proposed "how to calculate" pages. Items with an asterisk represent entries where the definition already includes an example of how to calculate the statistic.

+ How to calculate alpha.
+ How to calculate beta.
+ How to calculate a binomial mean and standard deviation.*
+ How to calculate a binomial probability.*
+ How to calculate a biserial correlation.*
+ How to calculate a conditional probability.*
+ How to calculate a correlation.*
+ How to calculate entropy.*
+ How to calculate a geometric mean.*
+ How to calculate an interquartile range.
+ How to calculate kappa.*
+ How to calculate a likelihood ratio.*
+ How to calculate a Mann-Whitney test.*
+ How to calculate a mean.*
+ How to calculate a median.*
+ How to calculate a mode.*
+ How to calculate a normal probability.*
+ How to calculate the odds.*
+ How to calculate an odds ratio.*
+ How to calculate percentiles.*
+ How to calculate a phi coefficient.*
+ How to calculate a Poisson mean and standard deviation.*
+ How to calculate a Poisson probability.*
+ How to calculate a p-value.
+ How to calculate a range.*
+ How to calculate a standard error.
+ How to calculate a standard deviation.*
+ How to calculate a t-statistic.
+ How to calculate a weighted mean.

I'd also like to show how to draw various graphic displays.

+ How to draw a boxplot.
+ How to draw a control chart.
+ How to draw a mosaic plot.
+ How to draw a stem-and-leaf diagram.

Some calculations are so simple that I will keep the examples as part of the definition. These include:

+ Negative Predictive Value
+ Positive Predictive Value
+ Sensitivity
+ Specificity

It may be a while before I get to this, as this is a major overhaul.
