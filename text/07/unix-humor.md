The website [www.netfunny.com][net1] has a lot of computer humor. Here's one that caught my eye because I am taking a class in Bioinformatics and am learning a lot about UNIX.

```
MERRY CHRISTMAS
better !pout !cry   
better watchout
lpr why
santa claus <north pole >town
cat /etc/passwd >list
ncheck list
ncheck list
cat list | grep naughty >nogiftlist
cat list | grep nice    >giftlist
santa claus <north pole   >town
who | grep sleeping
who | grep awake
who | grep bad || good
for (goodness sake) { 
                     be good
                    }
```

I've included links to some Wikpedia entries that document the particular Unix features that this joke highlights. Wikipedia also has a [list of common Unix commands][wik1]. 

You can find [this joke][net2] on netfunny. Netfunny has a [second fun Unix joke][net3] as well.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [old website][sim2].
