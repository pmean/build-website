**[StATS]:** **I deserve a promotion (June 22,
2007)**. [Category: Professional
details](../category/ProfessionalDetails.html)

Please note a related weblog entry: [External scholars needed to review
my promotion materials.](ExternalScholars.html)

I have a joint appointment as an associate professor with the School of
Medicine at the University of Missouri, Kansas City. I am looking to
produce the paperwork to ask for a promotion to full professor. I
thought that some of the material that I produce in this process might
be interesting to others. Perhaps not, but storage space on the web is
cheap. It will also allow me to organize my thoughts better and interact
more efficiently with others who will be helping me in this process.

I am in a nontenured position and I am in the non-MD, non-clinical
track. So it looks like my role is defined best by saying what I am not.
The guidelines for promotion are on the web at

-   <http://www.med.umkc.edu/facultyguidelines/NontenureGuidelines.pdf>

 My credentials are reviewed by a committee of

> *five Professors and Associate Professors who themselves are
> non-regular (non-tenure), non-MD and nonclinical MD faculty, plus the
> Chairman of the UMKC SOM Appointment and Promotion Committee for MD
> Faculty who shall serve ex officio and the school\'s faculty
> representative to the UMKC Promotion and Continuous Appointment
> Advisory Committee.*

If they like me, my application is reviewed by the Dean of the School of
Medicine. If I pass that hurdle, then I am reviewed by a university wide
promotion committee.

The criteria for promotion to full professor is that I excel in one of
three areas and perform well in a second area. The three areas of
consideration are:

1.  Teaching (*communication of extant knowledge, the ability to inspire
    or stimulate students and the ability to translate difficult
    concepts into easily understood principles*),
2.  Service (*dedication to the mission of the SOM and to the general
    welfare of the community*)
3.  Research (*creation of new knowledge, revision and/or
    re-conceptualization of understanding, and dissemination of new
    knowledge*).

Specific markers of excellence in teaching include

1.  *mastery of the discipline that he/she is teaching,*
2.  *knowledge and understanding of the process of learning,*
3.  *\[knowledge and understanding of\] the principles of teaching,*
4.  *skills with case-based or evidence-based teaching methods,*
5.  *development of a new course,*
6.  *substantial revision of an existing course,*
7.  *effective innovations in teaching techniques,*
8.  *\[effective innovations in\] curricular initiatives, and*
9.  *\[effective innovations in\] instructional technology.*

Specific markers of excellence service include

1.  *active membership in institutional or departmental committees,*
2.  *quality improvement activities,*
3.  *management of health service programs or clinics,*
4.  *management of laboratory or other critical facilities necessary for
    the mission of the school,*
5.  *innovative administrative activities,*
6.  *service on advisory boards,*
7.  *development of community outreach programs and*
8.  *leadership positions in community, state, and national service or
    professional organizations*

Specific markers of excellence in research include

1.  *grant awards,*
2.  *original publications and*
3.  *funding for investigative projects.*

The guidelines also remind you that

> *they are neither a rigid requirement nor an all inclusive list of
> acceptable scholarly activities*

The application form for promotion includes

1.  *Promotion Coversheet and Checklist,*
2.  *Personal Information Sheet,*
3.  *Self Appraisal Sheet,*
4.  *Scholarly Activities Descriptions and Sheets,*
5.  *Teaching, Professional/Clinical Service \[Descriptions and
    Sheets\],*
6.  *Advancement of Knowledge (Research)  \[Descriptions and Sheets\]*

and a form asking for five external scholars for soliciting evaluation
letters.

The guidelines suggest that candidates for promotion maintain a journal
or portfolio

> *which identify scholarly activities in sufficient detail to be
> recognized and evaluated by their peers.*

This portfolio is something, perhaps, that I can develop on these web
pages.
