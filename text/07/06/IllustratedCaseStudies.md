**[StATS]:** **Illustrated case studies of research
ethics and research fraud (created 2007-06-11)**.

I\'ve written a fair number of case studies involving research ethics
and research fraud for the Chance Wiki. I want to take some of this
material and produce some web pages with nice illustrations that will
bring these cases to life and make them more memorable. This may
eventually lead to a book, but that is quite a way down the road. Here
are some of the Chance Wiki entries that I might want to work on.

-   Chance News 22: [I wasn\'t making up data, I was
    imputing!](http://chance.dartmouth.edu/chancewiki/index.php/Chance_News_22#I_wasn.27t_making_up_data.2C_I_was_imputing.21)
-   Chance News 20: [A clumsy attempt at
    anonymization](http://chance.dartmouth.edu/chancewiki/index.php/Chance_News_20#A_clumsy_attempt_at_anonymization)
-   Chance News 18: [What does \"unable to replicate\"
    mean?](http://chance.dartmouth.edu/chancewiki/index.php/Chance_News_18#What_does_.22unable_to_replicate.22_mean.3F)
-   Chance News 4: [Can you get fired over the wording of a
    questionnaire](http://chance.dartmouth.edu/chancewiki/index.php/Chance_News_4#Can_you_get_fired_over_the_wording_of_a_questionnaire.3F)

There are lots of other interesting case studies that I could work on.

The TGN 1412 trial involves a surprising turn in a \"first in human\"
trials where six research subjects become violently ill. The
descriptions of this trial are quite graphic, so it would lend itself
well to an illustrated case study. For more details, see

The death of Ellen Roche during an experiment using healthy volunteers
is also an interesting case study. For more details, see
