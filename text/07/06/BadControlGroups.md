**[StATS]:** **When bad control groups happen to
good researchers (created 2007-06-15).**

The [Kansas City University of Medicine and
Biosciences](http://www.kcumb.edu/) wants me to give a light humorous
talk at lunch during the [2007 Homecoming CME and Reunion
weekend](http://alumni.kcumb.edu/s/68/index.aspx?sid=68&pgid=13&cid=97&gid=1&event_id=105350).
Somehow, they provided me with a title for my talk, \"Humor, Databases
and Grant Proposals: What Strange Bedfellows\" which is a fine title,
but not the one I would have chosen. I\'ll talk it over with the
organizers, but here\'s a possible choice:

-   \"When bad control groups happen to good researchers\"

Here\'s an abstract:

> \"Finding a good control group is an underappreciated art in research.
> We often don\'t notice this until someone makes a stunningly bad
> choice. In this talk, you will learn what to look for in a control
> group. You will also see the knots that researchers tie themselves in
> when they insist on a placebo arm in a birth control study and when
> they try to evaluate the prognosis of patients who are already dead.
> You will also see an example where two bad control groups can add up
> to a good comparison.\"

Most of the material for this talk will come from the first chapter of
my book, [Statistical Evidence in Medical Trials](../evidence.asp).

In order to get CME credit, I need to specify three objectives. Here
they are:

Â In this talk, you will learn how to:

-   recognize the importance of a good control group in research
    studies,
-   identify the characteristics of a good control group, and
-   appreciate the ethical and practical constraints in selection of the
    control group.

There\'s also a nice Shakespeare quote to use in the talk: \"It is
neither good nor bad, but thinking makes it so.\"
