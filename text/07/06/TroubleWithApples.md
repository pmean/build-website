**[StATS]:** **The trouble with apples and oranges
(created 2007-06-25)**

I am still working on the details of  a presentation for the [Kansas
City University of Medicine and Biosciences](http://www.kcumb.edu/).
They want me to talk at lunch during the [2007 Homecoming CME and
Reunion
weekend](http://alumni.kcumb.edu/s/68/index.aspx?sid=68&pgid=13&cid=97&gid=1&event_id=105350).
The new title is \"Medical Journals - The Trouble with Apples and
Oranges.\"

Here\'s a tentative abstract:

> \"Finding a good control group is an underappreciated art in research.
> We often don\'t notice this until someone makes a stunningly bad
> choice, leading to the classic difficulty of comparing apples and
> oranges. In this talk, you will learn what to look for in a control
> group. You will also see the knots that researchers tie themselves in
> when they insist on a placebo arm in a birth control study and when
> they try to evaluate the prognosis of patients who are already dead.
> You will also see an example where two bad control groups can add up
> to a good comparison.\"

Most of the material for this talk will come from the first chapter of
my book, [Statistical Evidence in Medical Trials](../evidence.asp).

In order to get CME credit, I need to specify three objectives. Here
they are:

 In this talk, you will learn how to:

-   recognize the importance of a good control group in research
    studies,
-   identify the characteristics of a good control group, and
-   appreciate the ethical and practical constraints in selection of the
    control group.
