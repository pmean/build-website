I was asked to fill out a conflict of interest form for a talk I will be giving in December. While I have not gotten any money directly from drug companies recently, I do have some financial support outside the hospital that might be considered a conflict of interest in some contexts. These sources of support do not relate directly or indirectly to the topic I will be discussing in December (or any of the topics that I plan to discuss), but it it better to disclose too much rather than too little. I will try to update this page as new sources of support appear.

**Ongoing**. I have been working with Fertility Solutions, Inc. on a study of sperm morphology classifications. The total consulting fees through October 2008 are less than \$5,000.

**Ongoing**. I have been working with the Cleveland Chiropractic College on a variety of research projects for pay. The total consulting fees through October 2008 are less than \$2,000.

**Ongoing**. I received royalties (variable, total to date less than \$3,000) from Oxford University Press from sales of my book, Statistical Evidence in Medical Trials: What Do the Data Really Tell Us?

**November 2007**. I received a \$500 honorarium and travel support (approximately \$600) from the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology to give a 30 minute talk in Dallas, TX at their annual conference.

**September 2007**. I received a \$500 honorarium from the Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences

**April 2007**. I received travel support (approximately \$400) from the American Society for Andrology to give a short course in Tampa, FL at their annual conference.

**March 2007**. I received a \$200 honorarium from the Medical Center of Independence to give a one hour seminar for their grand rounds in Independence, MO.

**January 2007**. I received a grant of \$3,200 from Children's Mercy Hospital to study accrual problems in clinical trials.

**December 2006**. I received \$1500 in travel support from the International Quality & Productivity Center to give a talk and short course in London, England at their annual Data Mining and Signal Detection conference

**October 2006**. I received a \$500 honorarium and travel support (approximately \$400) from the Midwest Society for Pediatric Research to give a talk in Indianapolis, IN at their annual conference.

There are additional sources of outside support prior to July 2006, which I will try to list when I have time.
