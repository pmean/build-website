**[StATS]:** **Resources for fMRI data analysis
(February 8, 2007)**.

> I was asked to provide feedback on a grant that will use functional
> magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as one component of the research.
> This technique is used to quantify brain activity by measuring changes
> in blood flow in various regions of the brain. It effectively produces
> information in the three dimensions of the brain structure, plus a
> dimension of time. The technology today can produce images localized
> to a cube with dimensions of approximately 2-4 mm, and these can be
> measured every 1-4 seconds. Each individual cubic region is called a
> voxel, a contraction of the words \"volume\" and \"pixel.\"
>
> The general goal of fMRI in research is to contrast brain activity in
> certain regions of the brain (such as the prefrontal cortex) between
> two or more groups of subjects and/or with two or more different
> sensory stimuli.
>
> The data produced in an fMRI study is especially challenging from a
> statistical perspective. A quick Medline search yielded a whole host
> of papers listing exotic statistical methods. Here are some examples
> (I\'m just reproducing the titles):
>
> -   Treatment of ill-balanced datasets of fMRI with Modified Fuzzy
>     c-means Method.
> -   ICASENSE: Sensitivity mapping using Independent Component Analysis
>     for parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
> -   fMRI bold signal analysis using a novel nonparametric statistical
>     method.
> -   A semi-parametric approach to estimate the family-wise error rate
>     in fMRI using resting-state data.
> -   Hidden Markov multiple event sequence models: A paradigm for the
>     spatio-temporal analysis of fMRI data.
> -   Smoothing and cluster thresholding for cortical surface-based
>     group analysis of fMRI data.
> -   Analyzing fMRI experiments with structural adaptive smoothing
>     procedures.
>
> The analysis of fMRI data requires extensive graphics processing and
> filtering. There are spatial and temporal autocorrelations that need
> to be accounted for. Some proprietary software for fMRI data analysis

> At the SPM website, you can find a nice introduction to some of the
> data analysis issues in a paper [Introduction to Statiswtical
> Parametric Mapping](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/intro/).
> Another resource discussing data analysis issues is:
>
> -   **Teaching Statistical Analysis of fMRI Data**. Ian Loai, Randy
>     Gollub, Richard Hoge, Douglas Greve, Mark Vangel, Russ Poldrack,
>     and Julie E. Greenberg. [\[PDF
>     format\]](http://www.vanth.org/docs/Lai_Gollub_Greenberg_ASEE03.pdf)
>
> There are several books out on fMRI analysis, and the one that looked
> like it has the most statistical content is
>
> -   **Computing Brain Activity Maps from fMRI Time-Series Images**.
>     Gordon E. Sarty.
>
> I may be asked to produce a power calculation, and a good reference
> for this is:
>
> -   **Estimating sample size in functional MRI (fMRI) neuroimaging
>     studies: statistical power analyses.** J. E. Desmond, G. H.
