*Dear Professor Mean, I'm conducting a number of web-based polls and
would like to include a margin of error in my results. How do I do
this?*

> I've got bad news and more bad news. First, the **traditional formula
> for the margin of error will not account for bias** and will grossly
> underestimate the uncertainty of your estimates. Second, **we can't
> quantify how much bias you are likely to have**.
>
> When you are conducting any poll, the first question you ought to ask
> is "what population am I trying to generalize these results to?" For
> example, if you ask the question "Would you vote for Rush Limbaugh
> for president of the United States in the year 2000?" the only
> logical population is all U.S. voters.

> In just about every case that I can envision, the population that you
> might be interested in extrapolating to would be severely
> misrepresented by a web-based sample. First of all, **your web-based
> sample is going to under-represent people who don't own computers**.
> Second, **your sample consists of volunteers, who usually hold much
> stronger viewpoints than the average person**.

> There are ways that you can estimate and adjust for bias. For example,
> in some polls you can **characterize the demographics of those who
> didn't respond**, and if those demographics are comparable to the
> demographics of the sample itself, then we might feel safer in
> claiming that there is no bias. Other times, we can get a rough feel
> for what non-respondents are like by using follow-ups and reminders,
> and **seeing if those who responded only after the reminder differed
> from those who responded right away**. Finally, if you know exactly
> how much certain groups are over or under-represented, sometimes you
> can **weight the results by the amount of underrepresentation to get
> an unbiased estimate**.

> I can't imagine, though, how you would apply any of these techniques
> to your web based sample. My advice is to use the same disclaimer that
> you see on these psychic hot-line numbers: "This poll has no
> scientific value and is intended for entertainment purposes only."
