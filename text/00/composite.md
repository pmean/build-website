****[StATS]:** Composite scores (January 27,
2000).**

*Dear Professor Mean, I have developed a method to distinguish among
several products that we need to buy so our company can make a good
purchasing decision. I created a composite score which is a weighted
average of several different indicators of quality. I want to use
statistics to determine when two different products have significantly
different composite scores.*

> It sounds like what you want is to **select a product on the basis of
> the highest composite score**, but **if two composite scores are
> close**, then you **break the tie on the basis of price or
> convenience**.
>
> I would argue that **statistics are a poor way to judge which scores
> are close**. I\'ve seen similar situations in medical research where a
> statistically significant change was of no practical importance. I
> helped with a medical study, for example, where we looked at various
> measures of male reproductive potential. One of the measures was semen
> pH. One group had a statistically significantly higher average level
> of semen pH, but it was 6.9 versus 7.2 or something like that. Sperm
> can function well in a much broader range of pH levels, so I am told.
> You would need to see a full unit change in pH or maybe even more
> before any doctor would worry.
>
> So I would suggest that you **talk to the same people who helped you
> develop you the weights** for your composite score and ask them to
> **tell you how much of a change in the composite score would be large
> enough to have a practical impact**. This is an example where
> statistics is a poor substitute for human judgment.
