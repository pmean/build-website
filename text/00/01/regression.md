****[StATS]:** Regression to the mean (created
2000-01-27).**

*Dear Professor Mean, In a stat course I was introduced to the term
\"regression to the mean\". Today we administered a pretest to 4th
graders. In Feb we will again test, with the same exam, to see \"how
much they\'ve learned\". I explained to the principal that, of course
they would do better, no matter how well they were taught, that this was
a classic case of regression to the mean. Am I correct, close, or way
off on this?*

> interested in the relationship between a child\'s height (when the
> child reaches adulthood) and the height of the parents**. There are
> several ways to look at the data: the height of the father versus the
> height of the child, the height of the mother versus the height of the
> child, or the average height of both parents versus the height of the
> child.
>
> One example, described on page 169 of Friedman, Pisani and Purves
> (1998), examines the relationship between the height of the father and
> the height of a male child. For this data, the correlation was 0.5.
> When you look at the prediction equation, though, the results at first
> seem a bit counterintuitive. **Without knowing anything else, you
> might expect that the best prediction for a male child\'s height would
> be the father\'s height**. In other words, if the father is 74 inches,
> your best prediction of the male child\'s height would also be 74
> inches.

> It doesn\'t quite work out that way, partly because **the average
> child\'s height (69 inches) was one inch greater than the average
> father\'s height (68 inches)**. That may be due to better nutrition or

> than 1.0**. What does this mean? If the father\'s height is above
> average, say by six inches, the child\'s height would be expected to
> be above average, but to a lesser degree (three inches). If the
> father\'s height was below average, say by four inches, the child\'s
> height would also be expected to be below average but by only two
> inches.
>
> So the rule for predicting child height is this. **Note how much the
> father\'s height deviates from the father mean of 68 inches. Cut that
> deviation in half. That tells you how much you would expect the
> child\'s height to deviate from the child mean of 69 inches.** For
> example, suppose a father\'s height is 72 inches. This is 4 inches
> above the father mean of 68. We would expect the child\'s height to be
> only 2 inches above the child mean of 69 inches. This means that 71
> inches is our best prediction of the child\'s height.

> tall children, but not usually as tall as they are. Short fathers tend
> to have short children, but not usually as short as they are**. This

> produce even taller children; there are some short fathers who produce
> even shorter children. But the general tendency is for the children to
> have heights slightly closer to the mean than their fathers.

> The same general tendencies hold, by the way, when you look at the
> mother\'s height, or the average of father\'s and mother\'s height.
>
> Now keep in mind that regression to the mean informs you about
> individual deviations from the group average. The children in the
> Galton\'s example as a whole were one inch taller than the fathers.
> Regression to the mean doesn\'t tell us anything about how an entire
> generation differs from the generation before it. What it tells us is
> how individuals deviate from the mean of their group.
>
> The same thing might happen in your data set. **Suppose the average
> student scores 50 at the start of classes and 70 at the end of
> classes**. Then regression to the mean will tell you how much students
> deviate from the mean of 70 at the end of classes on the basis of how
> much they deviated from the mean of 50 at the beginning of classes.
>
> **A student who is one standard deviation above the average score of
> 50 at the start of classes is probably going to be a bit less than a
> full standard deviation above average score of 70 at the end of
> classes**. So you might be a bit disappointed with students in the
> \"smart\" class.
>
> **A student who is one standard deviation below the average score of
> 50 at the start of classes is probably going to be a bit less than one
> standard deviation below the average score of 70 at the end of
> classes**. You might get encouraged by students in the \"dumb\" class.
>
> **Where regression to the mean tends to cause unexpected results is
> when you select students on the basis of their pre-test values**. For
> example, a naive researcher might split a sample of students into a
> \"smart\" class and a \"dumb\" class on the basis of a preliminary
> test. There might be, say a 10 point gap between the two groups based
> on the preliminary test. But all other things being equal, you should
> expect the gap between the \"smart\" and the \"dumb\" class to be
> narrower by the end of the year.
>
> Of course, you don\'t use terms like \"smart\" and \"dumb\" for your
> students. The point here is that if you segregate students on the
> basis of their performance at the start of the class, the amount the
> two groups appear to learn at the end of classes will vary even if
> nothing else differs between the two groups.
>
> **Regression to the mean also can appear in medical settings**. Quite
> often we will segregate patients into \"sick\" and \"healthy\"
> categories on the basis of some medical test. If we re-tested these
> groups at a later date, we would probably see that the \"sick\"
> category probably isn\'t quite as sick as we thought they were and the
> \"healthy\" category probably isn\'t as healthy as we thought they
> were.

**Some special situations**

> **Some processes show a natural progression in the averages, and we
> would expect a roughly similar progression in individual values.** For
> example, almost all children grow\--short children grow and tall
> children grow too. So, for example, a three year old child with a
> height above the average of all three year olds will, after a year,
> grow (maybe a little and maybe a lot). This pretty much guarantees
> that, at the age of four, this child will be even farther above the
> average height of all three year olds. That\'s not surprising and it
> is not a contradiction of regression to the mean. What you have to do,
> of course, is to look at that child\'s height relative to all four
> year old children.
>
> **When there is a natural progression in averages, regression to the
> mean is chasing a moving target.** If you select a group of normal
> healthy three year old children who all have heights above the average
> of all three year olds, then after a year, they will have heights that
> are above the average of all four year olds, but possibly by a smaller
> amount. Similarly, a group of sixth grade children who read at levels
> above the average of all sixth graders, will probably read at an even
> higher level a year later. But you would need to compare them, after a
> year, to the average reading level of all seventh graders.
>
> Also, **regression to the mean for individuals on the low end will
> tend to balance out regression to the mean for individuals on the high
> end**. So, if you select an average or unremarkable group of
> individuals, and there is no preferential selection of individuals
> above average and no screening or exclusion of individuals who are
> below average, then that group, as a whole, will not exhibit
> regression to the mean.
>
> Finally, **regression to the mean is a statistical tendency, so there
> will always be exceptions**. There will be some individuals who are
> above average at baseline and even more above average at the end of
> the study. It\'s also possible, once in a while for an entire group to
> move in a direction opposite of what regression to the mean would tell
> you. After all, any time you have randomness, unpredictable things can
> happen.
