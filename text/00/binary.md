*Dear Professor Mean, I have to calculate a sample size for a binary
outcome variable. The research study is on breast feeding failures
within 7 to 10 days of birth for mothers who intended to breast feed.
The rate of failure overall is expected to be about 12%. What sample
size do I need? -- Baffled Bob*

Dear Baffled,

> Breast feeding failure is an example of a binary outcome measure.
> There are only two possible values: the mother is successfully breast
> feeding at 7 to 10 days, or the mother is not successfully breast
> feeding at 7 to 10 days. Other examples of binary outcomes would be:
>
> -   the patient died (survived) within the first year of study,
> -   the patient experienced (did not experience) a specific side
>     effect,
> -   the patient had a positive (negative) result on a diagnostic test.
>
> The sample size you need when you outcome is binary is different than
> when your outcome is continuous. For a continuous outcome, you need to
> specify the variability of your outcome measure and how much of a
> change you would consider clinically relevant. For a binary outcome,
> you still need to specify the clinically relevant change. But you
> don't need a measure of variability. What you need instead is an
> estimate in your control group of the probability for one level of
> your binary outcome. You might also need to specify the distribution
> of your explanatory (independent) variable.

**Example**

> One of the factors that might influence breast feeding failure is
> whether the delivery was a vaginal birth or a C-section. Let's assume
> that roughly 20% of the mothers in the sample had a C-section.
> Expressing it in a different way, the ratio of vaginal births to
> C-sections is 4 to 1.
>
> Let's also assume that the rate of breast feeding failure is 15% in
> the C-section group and 30% in the vaginal birth group. You
> hypothesize that C-section babies fare better, because the mother
> stays in the hospital longer. The extra time in the hospital allows
> greater interaction with lactation consultants.
>
> You wish to use a two sided test at an alpha level of 0.05. You also
> want the power to be at least 0.80. Under these conditions, you would
> need a sample size of 435 mothers.
>
> [Show some of the formulas and calculations.]

**Summary**

> Baffled Bob wants to know how to calculate a sample size when his
> outcome variable is binary (has only two possible values). Professor
> Mean explains that you need to specify the probability of an outcome
> at two different values of your predictor or independent variable.
