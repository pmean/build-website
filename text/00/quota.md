****[StATS]:** Quota stratified random sampling. (January 28, 2000)**

*Dear Professor Mean, I'm doing my thesis right now and I have to use
quota stratified random sampling. I do not know the exact meaning of
this term.*

When you say "have to use" does that imply that someone is making you
use this method? If so, shouldn't that person give you a book or
reference that might help?

I am not familiar with the technical definition of quota stratified
random sampling, but generally quota sampling implies that you set a
quota for certain groups and you keep sampling until you meet the quota
in each group. Have you ever noticed those marketing folks who lurk in
the shopping malls with questionnaires on clipboards. Late in the
afternoon they swoop down on any males they can find because they've
already met their quota for females.

Everitt has a dictionary of statistics that defines quota sampling. You
can also find a description of quota sampling on pages 75-76 of Alreck
and Settle's book.
