This page is obsolete and is being included only for historical purposes. The proper copyright notice is included in the footer for every page.

When these pages were originally developed, the lawyers suggested that I copyright these pages. In January of 2008 I asked for and got  permission to place these pages under an open access license. What this  means is that you can use these pages however you like, including a  derivative work as long as you acknowledge the original source. A link  back to the original page or a listing of the URL of the page would be  sufficient acknowledgement.

People will sometimes ask for permission to link to my pages. That has  never been an issue. You can link to my site without any restrictions. It would be nice if you could let me  know you are linking to my page. Also it would be nice if you could send me the URL of the  page that includes the link to my site. That way, I can show my boss how much interest my web  pages are attracting.


You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [website][sim2].
