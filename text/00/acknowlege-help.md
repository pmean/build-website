These web pages have several Sherlock Holmes quotes. These quotes can be found in the marvelous book *Statistically Speaking. A Dictionary of Quotations*, by C.C. Gaither and A.E. Cavazos-Gaither, Institute of Physics Publishing, Bristol, UK (1996).

Personal thanks to the many people who have sent comments and corrections. I should especially single out Dicon Montford who caught many spelling and grammar errors.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [original website][sim2].
