****[StATS]:** Important disclaimer.(2000-01-28)**

Although I work in a hospital, my profession is Statistics. I help the
doctors and nurses here plan research studies and make sense of the
numbers after the research is done. **I am totally unqualified to
provide medical advice.** If you have a question about Statistics, like
"When would you use a median instead of a mean to summarize your
data?" then I can provide an intelligent answer.

Some questions that might seem to you to be statistical in nature, such
as, "What is the average age that infants can start taking solid
foods?" but which I am still unqualified to answer. **If you are unsure
about whether the question is medical or statistical, go ahead and
ask**. The worst that will happen is that you will get a polite "Sorry
I don't know" response back.

**There are some good web sites that do offer medical advice from
professionals**. I would encourage you to check these sites out in
addition to any advice you get from your family physician. **If you find
any helpful advice at any of these other web sites, please let me
know**. If none of these sites are helpful, please also let me know so I
can stop recommending them to people.

    consulting, and confidential medical questions and answers.
