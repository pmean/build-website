*Dear Professor Mean, I have developed a method to distinguish among
several products that we need to buy so our company can make a good
purchasing decision. I created a composite score which is a weighted
average of several different indicators of quality. I want to use
statistics to determine when two different products have significantly
different composite scores.*
