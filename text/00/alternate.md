****[StATS]:** Alternating treatments (created
2000-08-22).**

*Dear Professor Mean, I'm running an experiment where I randomize by
alternating between the treatment and the control. I was told this is
not the proper way to do this. Why not?*

> When statisticians talk about randomization, they mean a sequence that
> as unpredictable as the roll of a die or the flip of a coin. Any
> systematic and predictable assignment will have problems.
>
> There are two reasons to randomize. First, randomization equalizes the
> assignment. It prevents the sicker patients, the younger patients, or
> the poorer patients from gravitating to one group preferentially.
> Second, randomization creates an unpredictable sequence. An
> unpredictable sequence prevents conscious or subconscious attempts to
> manipulate the findings.

**Randomization equalizes assignment**

> I heard a story about some research about water pollution. The
> scientists had five tanks with differing levels of a pollutant. From a
> big tank of fish, they took the 20 fish and put them in the first
> tank. Then they took another 20 fish and put them in the second tank.
> The next 20 fish went in the third tank and so forth. The scientists
> counted the number of fish who died after being exposed to varying
> levels of the water pollution.
>
> The results were quite interesting. The number of fish that died was
> not related to the pollution levels but instead to the order in which
> the tanks were filled. The first tank had the most deaths and the last
> tank had the least deaths. How could this have happened?
>
> Think about the process of catching fish. The first fish you catch are
> the slow moving ones. They're kind of sluggish. They may only be a
> few hours from floating at the top of the tank. The last fish you
> catch are the vigorous swimmers who always darted out of the way of
> the net at the last second.
>
> So when the scientists filled the tanks in a systematic order, they
> put the slow sick fish in the first tank and the fast healthy fish in
> the last tank. This is a problem. The order of assignment becomes an
> artificial factor that interferes with your ability to distinguish
> among levels of water pollution.
>
> Alternating assignments can create the same problem. Consider how
> cabbages grown in a garden. You will often see a pattern of big
> cabbage, little cabbage, big cabbage, little cabbage. These plants are
> competing for resources. One plant gets a tiny head start, and its
> roots extend over into the other plant's space, grabbing some extra
> water and nutrients. This leads to more growth and more grabbing of
> the other plant's resources.
>
> This type of pattern can also occur in factories. Consider a mill that
> cuts small pieces of wire from a large spool of wire. The machine
> might cut the first piece a bit large because it waited a fraction of
> a second too long. When this happens, the next piece is likely to be
> too small. If a piece is cut a bit small, the bit of extra left over
> might make the next piece too big.
>
> Suppose you are monitoring the amount of time a doctor spends with
> each patient. If the first patient goes a bit long, the doctor is
> likely to rush the next patient. A doctor that can wrap up a patient
> quickly, will then feel more relaxed and take more time with the next
> patient. So there might be a tendency for visits to go long, short,
> long, short. It doesn't always have to happen this way. The days when
> I visit the doctor it seems like the pattern for the four patients in
> front of me is long, long, long, long.
>
> It's also true that not every garden has the big cabbage, small
> cabbage, big cabbage, small cabbage. Still, as long as there is a
> possibility for this pattern, you want to avoid assigning your
> treatments the same way. A random assignment will mix things up so
> that the first, third, and fifth cabbages (which all happen to be big)
> aren't all assigned to the Miracle Gro group and the second, fourth,
> and sixth cabbages (which all happen to be small) aren't all assigned
> to the manure group. A non-random alternation can turn the whole
> research project into a big pile of manure.

**Randomization creates unpredictability**

> In some research settings, it helps if the people involved don't know
> what's coming next. An element of unpredictability prevents conscious
> or unconscious biases from affecting the research.
>
> For example, there is often some level of subjectivity in deciding
> whether a patient is eligible for a research study. If the doctor
> doing the recruiting knows which treatment is coming up next, he or
> she might consciously or subconsciously try to manipulate the
> eligibility requirements. For example, suppose a newly arriving
> patient might be scheduled to be placed into a treatment group that
> the doctor views as less favorable for that patient. One way to
> manipulate the assignment is to delay entry into the study, so that
> the patient gets enrolled into the desired treatment group.
>
> There are some serious and complex ethical issues involved if a doctor
> agrees to recruit patients into a research study, but believes that
> all (or even some) of his/her patients would be better off with one
> experimental therapy rather than the other one offered. Nevertheless,
> some doctors still participate in such a study.
>
> You can prevent a doctor from manipulating the study by first blinding
> the allocation list of subjects. This means that you don't tell the
> doctor which treatment the patient will be assigned to until after the
> eligibility requirements are all verified. You can do this by using a
> sealed envelop that the doctor opens only after verifying eligibility
> or by having the doctor call a research coordinator to find out the
> assignment.
>
> You also need to randomize the allocation list of subjects. Suppose a
> doctor does not know which assignment is coming up next, but he/she
> knows that the previous six subjects were assigned as B, A, B, A, B,
> A. That doctor would have a pretty good idea that upcoming patient
> would be assigned to B.
>
> Two publications (Colditz et al 1989, Schulz 1996) have quantified
> significant amounts of bias in the findings of research studies that
> alternate between assignments rather than randomize.
>
> Another situation where unpredictability is important is when you
> expose your research subjects to two or more conditions in sequence.
> If the subjects can guess the next item in the sequence, they many
> consciously or subconsciously manipulate the results of the
> experiment. The most obvious example of this is in research that
> attempts to assess psychic ability, such as the ability to predict
> which card will come next in a deck of cards. If the cards are not
> shuffled, then the ability to predict the next card is not as much
> psychic ability as it is the ability to recognize patterns in the
> unshuffled card deck. This seems like a trivial example, but there are
> situations much like the psychic prediction of card sequences where
> failure to properly randomize led to the subjects being able to guess
> the correct answer without having any psychic ability.
>
> A recent publication (Marks and Colwell 2000) showed just such a
> situation. Rupert Sheldrake has claimed that blindfolded subjects can
> sense when they are being stared at, and that this is evidence "an
> influence somehow reaches out" from the starer. There is empirical
> evidence to support such a finding, and this evidence is examined in
> Marks and Colwell. These authors argue that the order in which the
> research subjects were stared at followed a pattern that became
> readily discernable over time. When these researchers substituted a
> truly random sequence, the subjects could not perform better than
> expected due to chance.
