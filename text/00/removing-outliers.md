*Dear Professor Mean, I have recently conducted a survey of attitudes
toward research from a professional group. There are some outliers (+/-
3SD) that I would eliminate , but others conducting the research with me
feel that this might be a minority view, and should not be eliminate
from the dataset\...\...any views or references that I should read to
confirm my view, or theirs?*

> MEDICAL reason to do so**. Even then you might want to think twice.

> serious biases**. One possible exception is when you specify in your
> original protocol how outliers will be handled (e.g., any lab result
> outside three standard deviations will automatically be re-tested).

> The other thing to keep in mind is that **sometimes the outliers are
> more interesting than the rest of the data**. Think about cancer
> patients who survive much longer than their peers. Why would you want
> to remove these "outliers"? These are the people you should be
> studying the most.

> these unusual data values. If oultliers are exclusively in a
> particular demographic category (e.g., a specific age group), you have
> a great discovery that you might have missed if you just mindlessly
> tossed out the data.
>
> There are a lot of good approaches to handling outliers, although your
> original inclination to remove them without further effort is not the
> best choice.
