*Dear Professor Mean, Everyone says that smoking causes cancer, but we
can't really say that, can we? There is an association between smoking
and cancer, but we know that association does not imply causation,
don't we?*

**Short explanation**

> A good review of when we can make the leap from association to
> causation is a 1965 article by Sir Austin Bradford Hill "The
> Environment and Disease: Association or Causation". He mentions nine
> factors:
>
> 1.  Strength (is the risk so large that we can easily rule out other
>     factors)
> 2.  Consistency (have the results have been replicated by different
>     researchers and under different conditions)
> 3.  Specificity (is the exposure associated with a very specific
>     disease as opposed to a wide range of diseases)
> 4.  Temporality (did the exposure precede the disease)
> 5.  Biological gradient (are increasing exposures associated with
>     increasing risks of disease)
> 6.  Plausibility (is there a credible scientific mechanism that can
>     explain the association)
> 7.  Coherence (is the association consistent with the natural history
>     of the disease)
> 8.  Experimental evidence (does a physical intervention show results
>     consistent with the association)
> 9.  Analogy (is there a similar result that we can draw a relationship
>     to)

>     demolished.
> 5.  There is a **dose response** relationship (heavy smokers are at
>     greater risk than light smokers).
> 6.  I'm not sure if we know enough about cancer to provide a specific
>     **mechanism**. Perhaps we can invoke some of the ideas we know
>     about how certain chemicals can cause DNA damage.
> 7.  There is **coherence** in that lung cancer rates rise with smoking
>     rates and the rates are higher in countries where a lot of people
>     smoke.
> 8.  **Experimental interventions** do work. Getting people to quit
>     smoking has been shown to greatly reduce their risk for cancer.
> 9.  I'm not aware of **analogy** to smoking. Perhaps the fact that
>     cigar smoking and pipe smoking are associated with cancers of the
>     mouth.

**Summary**
