*Dear Professor Mean, Can you send me a basic definition of splines?*

<!---More--->

A spline is a wiggly curve that changes its wiggles as it moves along
to try to touch each data point. It changes the wiggles in a graceful
manner so that it gives the appearance of a single curve.

Statisticians also use smoothing splines which don't wiggle enough to
go through every single data point, but which still try to get
reasonably close to the data.

Have you ever seen the french curve that is used in drafting? It is a
way to connect consecutive points in a way that looks smooth and
natural. Splines work in a similar fashion.

I'm sure you were also interested in a technical definition. No? Well
you're going to get one anyway. A spline is a series of cubic
polynomials. Each cubic polynomial fits to a group of consecutive
values. You also constrain those cubic polynomials to be continuous
and smooth (smooth means it has a continuous first derivative).
That's the mathematical definition.

An alternative to the spline is a locally weighted average. For this
approach, at each data point, averaging or a simple regression model
is fit to data with high weight given to values that are close on the
x-axis and low weight given to values that are far away on the x-axis.
When points are very far away on the x-axis, they are given zero
weight.

Here's an example, looking at a lottery taken in the California
recall election that randomly assigned each letter of the alphabet.
Notice a slight tendency early in the process to select letters later
in the alphabet. This is a small sample and both splines and locally
weighted averages tend to have more uncertainty at the extremes, so it
is possible that this is just an artefact.
