*Dear Professor Mean, I have a graph of the trend for the mean frequency
of injuries among children from 1 to 11 years of age. The shape of the
curve suggests a nonlinear relationship between the age and the
frequency of injuries. Is there some software that would provide the
best fitting curve for this data from among a large family of nonlinear
curves?*

Dear Reader,

You might want to think twice about this endeavor. **Finding the best fitting curve from among a large family of curves has some of the same pitfalls that stepwise regression has**. Both approaches will tend to overfit your data.

In particular, **any statistical tests would be invalid** when you select the curve solely on the basis of your data. The curve you get **will not extrapolate well** beyond the range of your data, and it is likely to have **poor agreement with any future data** you collect.

**If you don't have any a priori or theoretical basis from which to choose an equation, then a nonparametric approach like smoothing splines has a lot of appeal**. In particular, you might find a generalization of Poisson regression, the generalized additive model, to work very well here. Refer to Hastie and Tibshirani's book for more details.
