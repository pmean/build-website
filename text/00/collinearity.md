*Dear Professor Mean, Could you describe the term collinearity for me? I
understand that it has to do with variables which are not totally
independent, but that is all I know!*

> Collinearity is a situation where there is close to a near perfect
> linear relationship among some or all of the independent variables in
> a regression model. In practical terms, this means there is **some
> degree of redundancy or overlap** among your variables.
>
> Some authors describe this as multicollinearity, near collinearity, or
> ill conditioning. Coming up with four different technical terms for
> the same condition is one way that we statisticians keep our
> discipline mysterious and awe inspiring.
>
> Collinearity can appear as a **very high correlation** among two
> independent variables, but it doesn't have to work that way. Another
> type of collinearity is when **several of the variables add up to
> something that it very close to a constant** value.
>
> Collinearity is not a fatal flaw, but it does cause a **loss in
> power** and it **makes interpretation more difficult**.
>
> A simple example of collinearity is when you are using both
> **gestational age** and **birth weight** as independent variables.
> These two measures are highly correlated, of course, since low
> gestational ages tend to be associated with low birth weights.
>
> Interpretation is difficult in this situation, because when both
> variables are in a regression model, the parameter for birth weight is
> measuring the effect of a change in one unit in birth weight on the
> dependent variable, assuming that all of the other variables are held
> constant. **It's hard to envision what it means to change birth
> weight while gestational age is held constant**. What you are looking
> at, in effect, is the size of a baby for a gestational age.
>
> Collinearity also causes a loss in power. **When you have overlap
> among some of the variables, it takes more data to disentangle the
> individual effects of these variables**. Think of it as a table where
> you push two of the four legs away from the corners and close to the
> middle of the table. Such a table will be very unstable.
>
> In the previous example, we have very few 1000 gram babies who are 40
> weeks gestational age and very few 2500 gram babies who are 32 weeks
> gestational age. Without data at these two "corners" of the table,
> it's hard to get stable statistical estimates.
>
> It should be noted, though, that **you can make sense of your data,
> even when you have collinearity**. It just takes more data and a bit
> of care in interpretation. Some health outcomes, it turns out, are
> related more closely to gestational age than to birth weight. It's
> not how small you are that is as important as how early you make your
> entry into the world. Keep in mind that I'm not a doctor (see my
> [disclaimer](disclaimer.html)), so check my limited knowledge of
> medicine out with the experts. Especially if you are a newborn baby.
