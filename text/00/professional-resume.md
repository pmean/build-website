Served as a co-instructor for NIOSH Training Course 553, "Statistical Analysis for Industrial Hygiene Sampling and Decision Making" which was offered on an annual basis from 1988 through 1993. I delivered approximately 6 to 8 hours of lectures in a 36 hour class, covering topics such as Normal and Lognormal Distributions; Distributions of Means and Errors in Exposure Measurements; Confidence and Tolerance Limits; and Selection of Workers and Times to be Sampled.

Chaired the planning committee for the April 2004 short course by C Davis on Statistical Methods for the Analysis of Repeated Measurements. Served on the planning committees for: the February 1996 short course by R. Helms on Mixed Models, the March 1993 short course by R. Hogg on Total Quality Management; the April 1992 U.S. Public Health Service Professional meeting; the March 1992 ENAR Biometrics meeting; and the November 1990 Ohio Statistics Conference.

Served as discussion leader for a round table discussion "SAS/Graph on the PC: User Experiences" held at the 15th annual SAS Users Group International conference, April 1990, in Nashville, TN.

Assisted in the preparation of a poster "Statistics at NIOSH" which was on display at the Hamilton County Public Library (main branch) during November 1989 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the American Statistical Association.

Participant in a workshop: "Methods for semen studies in humans," held in Washington DC, October 1989. I led discussion in three areas: "Assessing variability between and within individuals"; "Design considerations for parameters measured on individual cells"; and "Recoding continuous semen quality data as a binary response: the application of tolerance intervals to morphometry data." I also served as rapporteur for the statistical methods section that included these three discussions.

Programmed and tested in 1987 with LM Quinn a set of Turbo Pascal programs (SAMPLE, SAMSTAT, CONFINT, CHART, and HISTGRAM) that illustrate the random sampling process on real world data sets. In my Business Statistic courses, I have run these programs as part of my lectures on the Central Limit Theorem, on the effect of sample size on sampling error, and on the meaning of confidence in a 95% confidence interval. In addition, I have used these programs in a presentation, "Simulating Random Sampling" (see above) and in "Using some Turbo Pascal programs to simulate random sampling in the classroom" (also see above).

Programmed, documented, and tested in 1986 a series of benchmarks written in BASIC and Pascal (NUMACC.BAS and NUMACC.PAS) to evaluate numerical accuracy.
