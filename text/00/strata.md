****[StATS]:** Stratified random sample. (August 23, 2000)**

*Dear Professor Mean, What is a stratified random sample and why would I
want to use one?*

> **A stratified random sample is an alternative to a simple random
> sample that provides more precision.** In a simple random sample, you
> would select subjects randomly from a single large pool. In a
> stratified random sample, you would divide this large pool of subjects
> into several groups (strata) and then randomly select subjects from
> within each group. The number of subjects selected from each group is
> fixed by design.
>
> **A stratified sample makes sense when your data are heterogenous, but
> they can easily be split into strata that are more homogenous**. In
> other words, use a stratified sample when there is a lot variability
> between strata and little variability within strata.
>
> **The numbers that you select from each strata should normally be
> proportional to the size of the strata**. For example, in a population
> of asthmatic children, you might know that 90% of the subject pool are
> boys. Then it would make sense to randomly select exactly 9 boys for
> every girl that you sample.
>
> **In other situations, you may by design decide to oversample in some
> of your small but important strata**. For example, many national
> surveys of health trends will purposefully oversample minority
> populations. This ensures that there are enough subjects in these
> groups to allow you to study minority-specific health problems.
>
> **You can use a stratified sample only when you know which subjects
> belong to which strata prior to data collection**. If you only find
> out information about the strata during the interview or testing of
> subjects, then you can't control the selection of subjects in
> advance.
