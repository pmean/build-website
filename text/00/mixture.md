****[StATS]:** Mixture models (January 27, 2000).**

*Dear Professor Mean, I have read a journal article where the authors
used a mixture model . What is this?*

> There are two interpretations for mixture models that I am aware of.
>
> A mixture model is a model where **some or all of the independent
> variables are measured not in specific units like weight or length,
> but as a fraction or percentage of a total**. A lot of research
> involves blending several ingredients together. Some people make a
> martini, for example, as three parts gin and one part vermouth and
> others use a different mix like four parts gin and one part vermouth.
>
> The challenge in a mixture experiment is **to recognize and handle the
> inherent restriction that the sum of the mixture components is always
> 100%**. So if you are mixing three items, once you specify the
> percentages for the first two items, the percentage for the third item
> is known.
>
> **Diet studies** can offer a good example of mixture models. We want
> to compare health outcomes of people on the basis of the **percentage
> of calories that these people get from fat, carbohydrates, and
> protein**. Certain diets try to increase or decrease the relative
> percentages of some of these three components.
>
> A quite different type of mixture model is **when you know that your
> data are a mixture of apples and oranges, but you don't know which
> are the apples and which are the oranges**. You might, for example,
> see a bimodal distribution on a histogram that looks suspiciously like
> peaks from two separate normal populations. The mixture model is a way
> of identifying the two separate distributions without knowing which
> data values comprise the first peak and which data values comprise the
> second peak.
>
> **Genetics studies** offer a good example of this type of mixture
> model. Certain **genetic experiments involving quantitative traits**
> like metabolism lead to **data with a bimodal population**, but we
> **can't look at the individual genes** and identify which animals are
> genetically slow metabolizers and which ones are genetically fast
> metabolizers. We can use the distribution of metabolic rates, however,
> to identify the mean and standard deviations for the population of
> genetically slow metabolizers and genetically fast metabolizers.
>
> **Both types of mixture models require specialized software**. You
> shouldn't embark on a serious mixture model analysis without a
> face-to-face consultation with a professional statistician.
