****[StATS]:** Software used to create these web
pages. (August 24, 2000)**

> Here are a few details about the software I use to create these pages
> and some tricks I have learned over time.

**Web authoring**

> I use [Microsoft
> FrontPage](http://office.microsoft.com/home/office.aspx?assetid=FX01085802).
> I have several versions depending on whether I am at work or at home.
> I try to avoid any fancy features in FrontPage, because I don\'t want
> to use something proprietary that makes it difficult for someone with
> an alternative web browser.

**Math equations**

> I use [MathType](http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/) to
> create most of the formulas on these web pages. I save the files
> directly in GIF format and insert them into the page. The nice thing
> about MathType is that you can re-open the GIF file and the codes that
> created that GIF file reappear for further editing.

**Screen shots**

> I\'ve used almost a dozen different screen capture programs for these
> web pages. The current program I am using,
> [SnagIt](http://www.techsmith.com/), is quite good.

**Importing statistical graphs**

> I use S-plus to draw a lot of the simple line graphs on my web pages. 
> Here\'s an example:
>
> ![](../03/images/mle1a.gif){width="352" height="272"}
>
> It is very difficult to get the line graphs to look nice because when
> you try to scale the graphs, the very fine detail is often lost. I
> have found with repeated experience that it is best to produce a GIF
> file at the size that I want for the web page.
>
> `graphsheet(file="histogram##.gif",width=2.67,height=2,format="GIF")    # insert graphics code here.    dev.off()`
>
> This code produces a graph with a width of 192 pixels and a height of
> 143 pixels.
>
> Watch for text labels and the axes, because these will often be too
> large or too small. You can use the command
>
> `par(cex=0.5)    ``par(cex=2)`
>
> to make the text half as big or twice as big. If I do not need axes
> and labels, then the default graph will include a lot of white space.
> Te command
>
> `par(mar=rep(0.1,4))`
>
> will trim back almost all of the margins, including space that would
> have been reserved for the axes and labels.

**Bibliography**

> I maintain a bibliography of research articles, books, and web sites
> using [EndNote](http://www.endnote.com/). This software has a lot of
> nice options for formatting your bibliography the way you like best.
>
> I modified the fields for journal articles to include the PubMedID,
> and the URLs for the abstract, full text, and/or pdf formats of the
> article if they are available. I have a [PDF file describing these
> modifications](../details/Images/EndNoteReferenceTypes.pdf).
>
> I have an output style, \"Formal web format with no abstract\" that
> inserts html code automatically into any bibliography that I produce.
> This is what it currently looks like, though I plan to add a few more
> features (such as automatically incorporating a BookFinder4U link for
> any book that has an ISBN).
>
> ![](../details/Images/software1.gif){width="429" height="360"}
>
> \
> When I include an article, here is what it looks like:
>
> > **Missing the point (estimate)? Confidence intervals for the number
> > needed to treat.** Barrowman NJ. Cmaj 2002: 166(13); 1676-7.
> > [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12126323&dopt=Abstract)
> > [\[Full text\]](http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/166/13/1676)
> > [\[PDF\]](http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/166/13/1676.pdf)
>
> Here is what a web site looks like:
>
> > **[Calculating and Using NNTs
> > \[pdf\]](http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/Extraforbando/NNTextra.pdf)**.
> > Bandolier. Accessed on 2003-06-12.
> > www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/Extraforbando/NNTextra.pdf
>
> Here is what a book looks like:
>
> > **Evidence-based Medicine How to Practice and Teach EBM.** Sackett
> > DL, MD, Richardson SW, Rosenberg W, Haynes BR (1998) Edinburgh:
> > Churchill Livingstone. ISBN: 0443056862.
>
> These \"Formal web format with no abstract\" style is stored with the
> rest of the EndNote program under the Styles folder.
>
> EndNotes is a complex program, and one of the tricks I learned is how
> to incorporate a link only when I have certain information. There are
> \"Forced Separations\" symbols, denoted by the vertical bar (\|) and
> \"Link Adjacent Text\" symbols, denoted by a centered dot (a symbol
> not easily displayed on this web page) that are a bit tricky to learn
> how to use. When you learn out how they work, you can safely
> distinguish between books with and without an ISBN code.
>
> `<p><b>Title.</b> Author (Year) City: Publisher.     <a     href=http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/ISBN.html>    [BookFinder4U Link]</a>|</p>`
>
> The trick is to use the Link Adjacent Text symbol between the `<a` and
> the `    href=`, and between the `    [BookFinder4U` and the
> `    Link]`. You also need a forced separation between the `</a>` and
> the `</p>`. The Link Adjacent text insures that the elements always
> appear together or not at all, depending on whether the ISBN is known.
> Text following the Forced Separation appears no matter what happens
> with regard to the ISBN. We always want to include the `</p>` and
> while inserting a blank would work, that leaves an unnecessary blank
> dangling right before the end of the paragraph.
>
> The same tricks allow EndNotes to insert a link to the Abstract (but
> only when the abstract is available on the web), the Full Text (but
> only when the full text is available on the web), and so forth. If I
> have an Accession Number for a journal article, I can even link to the
> Medline citation of this article through the following code:
>
> `<a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi    ?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=Accession Number&    dopt=Abstract>[Medline]</a>`
>
> As in the previous example, you need a Link Adjacent Text symbol
> between the `<a` and the `href=`.

**Reprint requests**

> I have not yet included any comic strips, such as The Far Side or
> Dilbert, in my web pages, but I might start sometime soon.
>
> Reprint requests for Dilbert are sent to <reprints@unitedmedia.com>,
> and details about reprints appear in the United Media FAQ at
>
> > [www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/info/faq\_and\_contacts.html](http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/info/faq_and_contacts.html).
>
> Another nice selection of comics is available at Cartoonbank:
>
> > [www.cartoonbank.com/](http://www.cartoonbank.com/)
>
> which has many of the cartoons that originally appeared in The New
> Yorker.
>
> I also have an image from the CNN web site that I am asking for
> permission to use. The email address for this request went to
> cnn.viewersource\@turner.com.
