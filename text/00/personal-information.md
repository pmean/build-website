Here's some personal information about me.

I work at Children's Mercy Hospital (CMH) in Kansas City as a Biostatistician. I work in the Office of Medical Research and am supervised by Dr. Ralph Kauffman.

Before I came to CMH, I worked for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. I also have experience in teaching at Bowling Green State University.

My B.A., M.S., and Ph.D. all come from the University of Iowa. The latter two degrees came from the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science. My Dissertation Advisor, Dr. Russell V. Lenth, has a very nice home page with some interesting information about sample size and power calculations.

There's a mug shot of me on the CMH web pages. I was married on May 18, 2002. I have two pictures of my then fianc√©e, Cathy Ong, and me on a trip we took to China in March 2001. On September 9, 2004, we returned home from Russia with a newly adopted two year old boy, Nicholas Zhenya Simon. Here's a picture taken at the orphanage. More details about the adoption and other personal aspects of my life are on my Personal Update web page.
