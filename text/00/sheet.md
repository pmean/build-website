**[StATS]: Spreadsheet or Database? (created January
28, 2000)**

*Dear Professor Mean, I am not sure whether I should use a database or a
spreadsheet to enter my data?*

> **For data entry, there are several advantages for a database**.
> Databases easily allow you to implement **quality checks**. They also
> allow you to easily **integrate data from multiple sources**. Finally,
> they are more effective in **handling very large data sets.**
>
> **On the other hand, spreadsheets are faster to set up and allow
> easier copying and duplication for data with repetitive patterns**.
> Before you choose, make sure that the statistical software can import
> data from your database or spreadsheet.

**Advantages of a database**

> **First, databases allow you to implement quality checks in the
> data**. For example, one of your variables might be gender. It might
> be coded 1=Male, 2=Female, 9=Unknown (though if gender is unknown, you
> might want to look at the credentials of the doctor doing the
> examination). With a database, you could set up data entry in that
> field so that it would beep anytime you tried to enter something other
> than a 1, 2, or a 9.
>
> Another quality check found in databases is insuring that the same id
> code is not assigned to two different subjects. Database specialists
> refer to this as checking for unique primary keys.
>
> It's also possible to program a database to check for consistencies
> in dates. If the birth date is in 1994, for example, and the
> examination date is in 1987, then either your data are in error or you
> have an extremely far-sighted pre-natal care program.
>
> Yet another example is checking the gender or age of the subject
> before allowing certain data to be entered. Male subjects, for
> example, would not normally have a hysterectomy in their medical
> history. Five year olds are rarely married or widowed. The range of
> quality checks you can include in a database is limited only by your
> imagination.
>
> **Second, a database is effective at integrating data coming from a
> variety of sources**. For example, you might have data coming from a
> laboratory, a questionnaire, and from the medical records. A database
> makes it easy to properly link the information from all three sources.
>
> Another example of where a database is extremely useful is in a
> multi-center clinical trial. The database offers a standard way for
> data entry that helps avoid the inconsistencies that can plague such
> studies.
>
> Of course, if you have a data set so complex as to take information
> from three different sources, then you should definitely consult an
> expert early in the design of your study. Databases are nice, but they
> are no substitute for careful planning.
>
> **Third, a database is more effective at handling very large data
> sets**. Unlike a spreadsheet, the entire data set does not have to fit
> into computer memory. Of course, this is a factor only when the data
> set on the order of tens of thousands of records or more. If your data
> set is smaller than this then fitting all of the data into computer
> memory is unlikely to be a problem.

**Advantages of a spreadsheet**

> **On the other hand, spreadsheets can be up and ready for data entry
> faster than databases**. The extra time required by a database might
> be beneficial, but for a simple data entry situation, it might just as
> easily be overkill.
>
> **Spreadsheets also are more efficient at copying and duplicating
> blocks of information**. This can be a time-saver for data sets with
> repetitive patterns, such as multi-factorial experiments.

**Other considerations**

> **Before you choose, check to make sure that the statistics software
> can import your version of the spreadsheet or database**. SPSS for
> Windows, for example, can import Excel and Lotus spreadsheets, dBase
> format databases like FoxPro, as well as any database or spreadsheet
> which supports the ODBC (Open Data Base Connectivity) standard, like
> Access.
>
> Before you make your choice, be sure to factor in any human
> considerations. **If the person doing data entry is much more
> comfortable with a spreadsheet than a database (or vice versa), that
> might outweigh some of the computer efficiencies**. On the other hand,
> keep in mind that software in general, and database software in
> particular, is getting easier to use. Don't let lack of experience
> keep you from trying a database. It's easier than you think.

**Summary**

> In summary, databases allow for better error checking, for better
> integration of data from multiple sources, and for better handling of
> very large files. Spreadsheets are faster to get up and running, which
> can be an advantage for small tasks. Spreadsheets also have an
> advantage when there are repetitive patterns in the data.
>
> Which to choose? It may come down to how large and complex your data
> set is. **The bigger and messier the data, the more a database can
> help**.
