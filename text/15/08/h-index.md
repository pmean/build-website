It's a silly number, perhaps, but I tried to calculate my H-index today.
The H-index lists your publications in order from the most cited to the
least cited and then finds the value where rank order equals the number
of citations. My h-index is 24 which means that I have 24 papers that
have been cited 24 or more times. Confused? Here's a [better explanation
from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index). Anyway, I used
Research Gate to get an approximation to this (I'm not sure if Research
Gate has an accurate citation count).

Looking over the list of publications in order of citation, I see that I
have had the opportunity to work with a lot of very good researchers. I
do not show the authors in the list, but the top two articles were
written by Andrea Gaedijk, a genetics researcher at Children's Mercy
Hospital. A large number of the articles were secondary data analyses
that Vidya Sharma, also of Children's Mercy Hospital, had taken the lead
on (though in her unassuming ways, she often let someone else be the
lead author). Another source of articles with a high number of citations
was my work on male reproductive toxicology, mostly with Steve Schrader
at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.

Okay, here's the list of publications in order of citation.

I won't list the articles beyond here. I have around a hundred
publications. Needless to say, many of my publications have very few
citations.

If you look at the 23rd article in the list, that was cited 25 times.
The 24th article was cited 24 times and the 25th article was also cited
24 times. So my H-index is 24.

Is 24 a good number? Well, first you have to ask yourself whether the
H-index is a valid measure of research productivity. It has good face
validity. If you have only one or two articles that are cited a lot, you
won't score high and if you have a lot of articles, none of which a
cited a lot, you won't score well. You need to have some
consistency--the ability to produce a large number of highly cited
articles. Given that many research articles are rarely read, much less
cited [(see this Smithsonian article for real data on
this)](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/half-academic-studies-are-never-read-more-three-people-180950222/?no-ist),
an index of 24 sounds pretty good.

Quoting from the [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) mentioned earlier, "The
London School of Economics found that (full) professors in the social
sciences had average h-indices ranging from 2.8 (in law), through 3.4
(in political science), 3.7 (in sociology), 6.5 (in geography) and 7.6
(in economics)." No statisticians in that group, but I'm well above the
average of a bunch of other disciplines. On the other hand, the article
also states that "Among 36 new inductees in the National Academy of
Sciences in biological and biomedical sciences in 2005, the median
h-index was 57." So I have a ways to go.

Also worth noting is that in none of the articles among the top 24 most
cited articles was I the first author. I sincerely disagree with people
who make distinctions between among author order, as this is biased
against the Statistics discipline as a whole, but there are too many of
them to argue with.

So, for the record, the best publications I have where I am the first
author is "Benchmarking numerical accuracy of statistical algorithms"
which was cited 15 times, "Is the randomized clinical trial the gold
standard of research?" also cited 15 times, and "Understanding the odds
ratio and the relative risk" also cited 15 times. The remaining first
author articles were cited 14,10, 8, 5, 1, and 1 times.

So my H-index looking only at first author publications is 6. Note that
one of the articles cited only once was actually cited just by another
one of my publications. Obviously, I need to do more self-citations!
Seriously, though, an H-index of 6 for first author publications is not
too bad.

As a statistician, you would think that I'd be more careful than to
spend a morning calculating a number that has limited validity. But be
sure to read all of the criticisms of the H-index (and citation indices
in general) mentioned in the [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index).

Still, I'm convinced that I deserve a huge raise on the basis of my
H-index. Now I just have to figure out a way to get my boss to read this
blog post.
