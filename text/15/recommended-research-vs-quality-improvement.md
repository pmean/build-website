I ran across a one page handout in PDF format that discussed the
difference between research and quality improvement. It was written from
the perspective of the IRB (Institutional Review Board) at UMKC. It's a
nice summary, although the topic is a bit more complex than a single
page handout might imply. This is a good starting point for deciding
what type of study you want to do.
