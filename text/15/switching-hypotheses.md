One of the most confusing aspects of medical research is the difference
between non-inferiority and superiority trials. This article explains in
simple terms what the two type of trials are. Then it covers the desire
of many researchers to switch from a non-inferiority trail to a
superiority trial or vice versa. In general, if you would like to make
the claim of superiority if the data justifies it, or to fall back on a
claim of non-inferiority if you must, you are best off designing a high
quality non-inferiority trial. The extra methodological rigor and the
typically larger sample sizes that come with a non-inferiority trial
make the transition from a non-inferiority hypothesis to a superiority
hypothesis much smoother than the reverse. A high quality
non-inferiority trial includes pre-specifying the margin of
non-inferiority, demonstrating adequate power for the non-inferiority
hypothesis, and justifying that the control group has demonstrated
efficacy in previous trials. You need to show sufficient methodological
rigor in your research design to establish that a non-inferiority
finding is not just caused by an insensitive research design. Finally,
you need to consider a "per protocol" analysis for the non-inferiority
hypothesis, but switch to an "intention to treat" analysis for the
superiority hypothesis.
