I wrote a book about nine years ago and interest in it has largely died
down. Perhaps I should write a second edition. Anyway, I ran across a
book review that I had not seen before. It was published in 2006, but I
never noticed it until now. Sarah Boslaugh wrote the review and it got
published in MAA Reviews (MAA stands for Mathematical Association of
America). It says some nice things like my approach was "fresh." Dr.
Bosluagh also likes my web site, according to the review.
