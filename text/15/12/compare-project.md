One of the many problems with medical publications is that researchers
will choose which outcomes to report based on their statistical
significance rather than their clinical importance. This can seriously
bias your results. You can easily avoid this potential bias by
specifying your primary and secondary outcome measures prior to data
collection. Apparently, though, some researchers will change their minds
after designating these outcome variables and fail to report on some of
the outcomes and/or add new outcomes that were not specified prior to
data analysis. How often does this occur? A group of scientists at the
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford are
trying to find out.
