Here's a research article tackling the same problem of changing outcome
measures after the data is collected. Apparently, this occurs in 66 of
the 226 papers reviewed here or almost 30% of the time. The interesting
thing is that whether this occurred or not was independent of whether
paper was accepted. So journal editors are missing an opportunity here
to improve the quality of the published literature by demanding that
researchers abide by the choices that they made during trial
registration.
