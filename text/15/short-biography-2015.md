I get requests for a short biography from people asked to introduce me. I like to store these on my website so that I can refer to them and update them. Here's the latest short bio.

Steve Simon received a Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Iowa in 1982. He currently work as an independent statistical consultant and as a part-time faculty member in the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. He has previously worked at Children's Mercy Hospital, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and Bowling Green State University. He has over 90 peer-reviewed publications, four of which have won major awards. He has written one book, Statistical Evidence in Medical Trials, and is the author of a major website about Statistics, Research Design, and Evidence Based Medicine, www.pmean.com. One of his current areas of interest is using Bayesian models to forecast patient accrual in clinical trials.

Just so I can keep track of them, here are some of the earlier bios on my webpage.
