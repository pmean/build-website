The American Statistical Association is promoting careers in statistics though a new campaign titled "This is Statistics". They just added some very nice promotional material: one and two page handouts, a PowerPoint presentation (a bit too glitzy, but still very informative), and a set of talking points. The materials emphasize the broad range of areas that statisticians work in, the very strong pay and high demand for statisticians, and the diversity of people who go into Statistics.
