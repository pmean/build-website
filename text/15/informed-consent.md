Dear Professor Mean: Do you need an informed consent form if you are not
conducting research on human subjects?

<!---More--->

Well, you don't normally give informed consent forms to laboratory
mice.They chew up the forms and eat them.

Let's just make sure that you understand what "human subjects research"
is. According to the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, a human subject
is someone from whom you obtain data from interaction or intervention or
from whom you get identifiable private information. See
[www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html\#46.102](http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#46.102).

Research that does not involve human subjects is normally exempt from
IRB review. You might want to talk to someone on your IRB if there is
any potential ambiguity. It's often worthwhile to get a written
assurance of exempt status from your IRB before you start your research.

It's also worth noting that some types of human subjects research can
apply for a waiver of informed consent. For details, see
