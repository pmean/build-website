This Revolutions blog talks about a fairly rigorous evaluation of
popular programming languages done by the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (known by most people by its acronym, IEEE). The
list shows all programming languages, including general purpose
programming languages. Java C, and C++ are at the top of the list, but
R, a language pretty much dedicated to data analysis, is number 6 on the
list (up three places from the previous year. Quite an impressive
showing. I have mentioned another webpage,
<http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/>, that compares R and other
statistical software packages, and that is worth reading as
well.
