Dear Professor Mean, I want to run nonparametric tests like the
Kruskal-Wallis test and the Friedman test for a setting where there may
be more than one factor. Everything I've seen for these two tests only
works for a single factor. Is there any extension of these tests that I
could use when I suspect that my data is not normally
distributed.

<!---More--->

Most nonparametric tests based on ranks (like Kruskal-Wallis and
Friedman) do not extend well to additional factors. The reason for this
is that the assumption that all rankings are equally likely under the
null hypothesis does not work when testing the significance of one
factor when another factor might have variation in the outcome measure.

Any extension of these nonparametric tests would therefore no longer be
nonparametric. That doesn't mean that you can't use them, but it means
that most of the motivation for choosing them disappears.

There is an alternative, however. Ordinal logistic regression is able to
handle ordinal data like ranks and it is invariant to any montone
transformation of your outcome variable. And ordinal logistic regression
extends easily to multiple factors. It does have a pretty strong
assumption of parallelism, but this is something that you can easily
check. It certainly would be less restrictive than the assumption of
normality.

You should also consider transformations like the log transform that can
sometimes turn data that is highly skewed and heteroscedastic into nice
well behaved data amenable to the classic multifactor ANOVA models.
