It's a silly number, perhaps, but I tried to calculate my H-index today. The H-index lists your publications in order from the most cited to the least cited and then finds the value where rank order equals the number of citations. My h-index is 24 which means that I have 24 papers that have been cited 24 or more times. Confused? Here's a [better explanation from Wikipedia][wik1]. Anyway, I used Research Gate to get an approximation to this (I'm not sure if Research Gate has an accurate citation count).

Looking over the list of publications in order of citation, I see that I have had the opportunity to work with a lot of very good researchers. I do not show the authors in the list, but the top two articles were written by Andrea Gaedijk, a genetics researcher at Children's Mercy Hospital. A large number of the articles were secondary data analyses that Vidya Sharma, also of Children's Mercy Hospital, had taken the lead on (though in her unassuming ways, she often let someone else be the lead author). Another source of articles with a high number of citations was my work on male reproductive toxicology, mostly with Steve Schrader at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.

Okay, here's the list of publications in order of citation.

1.  The CYP2D6 Activity Score: Translating Genotype Information into a Qualitative Measure of Phenotype. Cited in 213 publications.

2.  Optimization of cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) phenotype assignment using a genotyping algorithm based on allele frequency data. Cited in 121 publications.

I won't list the articles beyond here. I have around a hundred publications. Needless to say, many of my publications have very few citations.

If you look at the 23rd article in the list, that was cited 25 times. The 24th article was cited 24 times and the 25th article was also cited 24 times. So my H-index is 24.

Is 24 a good number? Well, first you have to ask yourself whether the H-index is a valid measure of research productivity. It has good face validity. If you have only one or two articles that are cited a lot, you won't score high and if you have a lot of articles, none of which a cited a lot, you won't score well. You need to have some consistency--the ability to produce a large number of highly cited articles. Given that many research articles are rarely read, much less cited [(see this Smithsonian article for real data on this)][smi1], an index of 24 sounds pretty good.

Quoting from the Wikipedia article mentioned earlier, "The London School of Economics found that (full) professors in the social sciences had average h-indices ranging from 2.8 (in law), through 3.4 (in political science), 3.7 (in sociology), 6.5 (in geography) and 7.6 (in economics)." No statisticians in that group, but I'm well above the average of a bunch of other disciplines. On the other hand, the article also states that "Among 36 new inductees in the National Academy of Sciences in biological and biomedical sciences in 2005, the median h-index was 57." So I have a ways to go.

Also worth noting is that in none of the articles among the top 24 most cited articles was I the first author. I sincerely disagree with people who make distinctions between among author order, as this is biased against the Statistics discipline as a whole, but there are too many of them to argue with.

So, for the record, the best publications I have where I am the first author is "Benchmarking numerical accuracy of statistical algorithms" which was cited 15 times, "Is the randomized clinical trial the gold standard of research?" also cited 15 times, and "Understanding the odds ratio and the relative risk" also cited 15 times. The remaining first author articles were cited 14,10, 8, 5, 1, and 1 times.

So my H-index looking only at first author publications is 6. Note that one of the articles cited only once was actually cited just by another one of my publications. Obviously, I need to do more self-citations! Seriously, though, an H-index of 6 for first author publications is not too bad.

As a statistician, you would think that I'd be more careful than to spend a morning calculating a number that has limited validity. But be sure to read all of the criticisms of the H-index (and citation indices in general) mentioned in the Wikipedia article.

Still, I'm convinced that I deserve a huge raise on the basis of my H-index. Now I just have to figure out a way to get my boss to read this blog post.
