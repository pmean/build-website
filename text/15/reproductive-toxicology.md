The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a new biosketch format where they ask you to summarize "up to five of your most significant contributions to science." Here's a first draft of my research contributions to reproductive toxicology.

<!---More--->

At the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I worked with a toxicologist, Steven M. Schrader, on male reproductive toxicology. I should note that Dr. Schrader also supervised a strong program in female reproductive toxicology, and while I learned quite a bit about both sides of the equation, a different statistician served as co-author on the publications on female reproductive toxicology.

I was fortunate to arrive at NIOSH shortly after completion of a major longitudinal study of sperm samples in a healthy cohort of unexposed males. The longitudinal design required novel statistical measures and graphical displays. This data set produced many publications including two which won a major annual award, The Alice Hamilton award, for the best publication of the year in occupational safety and health.

One of the smaller findings from the longitudinal study, but one which illustrates some of the important considerations needed during the statistical planning of research studies, examined the general practice of requiring three separate blood draws to assess hormone levels such as testosterone. Since hormones are pulsatile, the three blood draws were assumed to help produce a more precise estimate of hormone levels for an individual. While this is certainly true, in an occupational health study, where the emphasis is often on comparing group means between exposed and unexposed populations, the three blood draws could possibly be "penny wise and pound foolish." The prospect of having three separate blood draws could reduce overall participation rates in a study and the longitudinal data set showed some hypothetical examples. Even a decrease in participation as small as 10 or 20% could wipe out all the gains in precision by requiring three blood draws rather than one.

In addition to the longitudinal study, I worked on the planning of studies in humans examining occupational exposures to non-ionizing radiation and lead, and helped develop a novel rabbit model for lead exposure.

My research in male reproductive toxicology taught me how to handle the complexities associated with longitudinal data and exposure studies.

As a side note, the lead author of the publication winning the Alice Hamilton award is asked to give a lecture at the following year's award ceremony. Since Dr. Schrader won in two consecutive years, he graciously allowed me to speak in place of him the second time around. I chose as my topic of my talk, a biography of W. Edwards Deming. I ended the talk with an exhortation that NIOSH should adopt the principles of quality control that Dr. Deming advocated. This talk led to the adoption of a Total Quality Management program at NIOSH and I served on the first quality improvement committee formed at NIOSH.
