A widely quoted statistic is that it takes 17 years for research to find
it's way from the initial discovery to clinical practice. That statistic
has always bothered me. How do you know that it takes this long? How
could you measure such a thing? Wouldn't it depend on the type of
discovery? Apparently, I'm not the only one bothered by this statistic.
The authors of this research paper looked at all the publications that
purported to estimate the time lag between discovery and clinical
adoption. They found that different authors used different markers for
the date of discovery and the date of clinical adoption. Furthermore,
reporting is poor, with little discussion of the variation in the
estimated time lag.
