If you are writing up a paper that uses a complex regression model
(complex meaning multiple independent variables), you need to document
information that allows the reader to assess the quality of the
predictions that your model would produce. This paper provides a
checklist of things that you need to document in such a paper, and is an
extension of the CONSORT guidelines to this particular type of
research.
