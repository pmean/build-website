I have not had time to preview this software, but it looks very
interesting, It takes large problems and converts them to a form for
parallel processing, not by changing the underlying algorithm, which
would be very messy, but by splitting the data into subsets, analyzing
each subset, and recombining these results. Such a method "Divide and
Recombine" should work well for some analysis, but perhaps not so well
for others. It is based on the R programming language. If I get a chance
to work with this software, I'll let you know what I think.
