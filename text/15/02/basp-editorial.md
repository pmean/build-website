Recommended does not always mean that I agree with what's written. In
this case, it means that this is something that is important to read
because it offers an important perspective. And this editorial offers
the perspective that all p-values and all confidence intervals are so
fatally flawed that they are banned from all future publications in this
journal. The editorial goes further to criticize most Bayesian methods
because of the problems with the "Laplacian assumption." The editorial
authors have trouble with some of the ambiguities associated with
creating a non-informative prior distribution that is, a prior
distribution that represents a "state of ignorance." They will accept
Bayesian analyses on a case by case basis. Throwing out most Bayesian
analyses, all p-values, and all confidence intervals makes you wonder
what they will accept. They suggest larger than typical sample sizes,
strong descriptive statistics (which they fail to define), and effect
sizes. They believe that by "banning the NHSTP will have the effect of
increasing the quality of submitted manuscripts by liberating authors
from the stultified structure of NHSTP thinking thereby eliminating an
important obstacle to creative thinking." It's worth debating this
issue, though I think that these recommendations are far too
extreme.
