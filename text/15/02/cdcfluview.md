I work a lot with secondary datasets and I'm always looking for new and
interesting resources. There is a CDC site that tracks flu reports and
with a bit of effort, you can get the raw data behind these reports. A
blogger, hrbrmstr (Bob Rudis, if you dig long enough to find his real

into R. He illustrates the use of this package with a graph that shows
some interesting trend lines across several major cities.
