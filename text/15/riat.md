Too much research data goes unreported, leading to a serious distortion
of the evidence base that clinicians need to make intelligent medical
decisions. The authors of this paper in BMJ argue that if you can
document that a study has been abandoned before publication, and if you
formally requestthe researchers to publish the data, and if they fail to
act within a certain amount of time,then the data should be considered
public access so that you or anyone else could publish those results.
It's an interesting proposal and one that will generate a lot of
controversy.
