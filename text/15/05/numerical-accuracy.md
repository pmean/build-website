The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a new biosketch format
where they ask you to summarize "up to five of your most significant
contributions to science." Here's a first draft of my research
contributions to numerical accuracy.

<!---More--->

At Bowling Green State University, I partnered with an Economics faculty
member, James P. Lesage, to study numerical accuracy issues. The major
statistical software packages were just being ported to microcomputers
and the combination of single precision calculations with the
(sometimes) poorly implemented algorithms led to some startling bad
results. These publications started with the seminal data set for
numerical accuracy, the Longley data set, and looked at a flexible
alternative developed by Wampler. We developed an extension to the
Wampler data set that could examine near collinearity involving the
intercept term and produced new benchmarks for Analysis of Variance.
Some of these benchmarks were adopted by the National Institute for
Standards and Technology for their Statistical Reference Datasets
project. I also produced a couple of pedagogical articles that clearly
illustrated how problems with numerical accuracy can arise. The work in
this area gave me an early overview of the broad range of statistical
software packages available for microcomputers.
