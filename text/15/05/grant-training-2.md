I usually do not recommend commercial products, as I know most of you
have very limited funds. But when it comes to grants, you should
consider paying for good training. The best grant writing class I ever
took was from David Morrison, who is part of Grant Writers Seminars and
Workshops. Also good are the seminars produced by the Grant Training
Center. Details on both groups are listed below.
