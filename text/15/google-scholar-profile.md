<div class="notes">

A while back, I set up a publication list in Google Scholar. It tracks the number of citations received by each article that I published. One of my articles has a massive 287 citations. I'm not the first author on this or on an of the other articles that received 100+ citations. So I'm mostly riding on the coattails of some very good researchers.
