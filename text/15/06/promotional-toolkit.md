The American Statistical Association is promoting careers in statistics
though a new campaign titled "This is Statistics". They just added some
very nice promotional material: one and two page handouts, a PowerPoint
presentation (a bit too glitzy, but still very informative), and a set
of talking points. The materials emphasize the broad range of areas that
statisticians work in, the very strong pay and high demand for
statisticians, and the diversity of people who go into
Statistics.
