I get requests for a short biography from people asked to introduce me.
I like to store these on my website so that I can refer to them and
update them. Here's the latest short bio.

<!---More--->

Steve Simon received a Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Iowa
in 1982. He currently work as an independent statistical consultant and
as a part-time faculty member in the Department of Biomedical and Health
Informatics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. He has previously
worked at Children's Mercy Hospital, the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health and Bowling Green State University. He
has over 90 peer-reviewed publications, four of which have won major
awards. He has written one book, Statistical Evidence in Medical Trials,
and is the author of a major website about Statistics, Research Design,
and Evidence Based Medicine, www.pmean.com. One of his current areas of
interest is using Bayesian models to forecast patient accrual in
clinical trials.

Just so I can keep track of them, here are some of the earlier bios on
my webpage.
