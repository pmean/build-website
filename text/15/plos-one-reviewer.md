<div class="notes">

I don't do nearly enough peer reviewing, in part because it is a thankless, anonymous task. But one journal editor sent me a nice email pointing out that my name was listed along with 80,000 other reviewer names for helping out with peer review of an article in 2014 for PLOS ONE. If you click on the link on the article and go down about 61,000 lines, you'll find my name. Caution, the list is not quite perfectly in alphabetical order (Simons and Simonton should come AFTER Simon).
