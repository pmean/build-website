Life in the world of research is complicated, but it gets worse when you
have a relatively common last name like "Simon." There are thousands of
research publications written by a Simon, and narrowing it down to
"Simon S" or even "Simon SD" doesn't seem to help. So how do you quickly
identify all the publications that you have written? One way is to apply
for a unique identifier from ORCID, an "open, non-profit,
community-based effort to provide a registry of unique researcher
identifiers and a transparent method of linking research activities and
outputs to these identifiers."

I did that today and my ORCID ID is 0000-0002-0613-008X. You can find a
brief biography of me at ORCID by going to
<http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0613-008X>. I will work on this and add
publications that are really the true SD Simon and not someone else who
happens to share my last name and first two initials. It will help some,
but I suspect I will always have problems with this. For details, see
