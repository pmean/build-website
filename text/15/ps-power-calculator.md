Someone stopped by today with a power calculation and I asked what
software they used. They showed me something I had not seen before, a
program developed by the Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt
University (more specifically, William Dupont and Walton Plummer). The
Vanderbilt Biostatistics Department is run by Frank Harrell, so you can
be pretty sure that anything that they develop will be high
quality.
