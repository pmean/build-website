If you are writing up a paper that uses a complex regression model (complex meaning multiple independent variables), you need to document information that allows the reader to assess the quality of the predictions that your model would produce. This paper provides a checklist of things that you need to document in such a paper, and is an extension of the CONSORT guidelines to this particular type of research.
