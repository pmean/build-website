I've been looking for a few interesting data sets for use as teaching
examples. I wanted data associated with peer-reviewed publications. It's
a difficult and tedious search, but here are a few promising
leads.

Normative Data for Email Writing by Native Speakers of British English.
Authors: Lindsey Thiel , Karen Sage, Paul Conroy. Journal of Open
Psychology Data.
<http://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jopd.aj/>

This is a simple Word document that might be useful for text analytics.
Forty two subjects were asked to write short emails with a three minute
time limit. Each subject wrote three emails:

1.  an email to a friend arranging a meeting,
2.  an email to a friend describing a recent trip, and
3.  an email to a local political representative about an issue of
    concern to you.

Data from "Demographic Influences on Disgust: Evidence from A
Heterogeneous Sample." Authors: Uri Berger, David Anaki. Journal of Open
Psychology Data.
<http://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jopd.ag/>

The disgust scale is a 25 item survey with three subscales (core
disgust, animal reminder, and contamination based disgust). The survey
was given to 1,414 Israeli citizens. The individual items and the
composite values as well as a wealth of demographic data are included.

Jessica F. Stephenson, Cock Van Oosterhout, Ryan S. Mohammed, and Joanne
Cable. 2015. Parasites of Trinidadian guppies: evidence for sex- and
age-specific trait-mediated indirect effects of predators. Ecology
96:489--498. <http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E096/050/suppl-1.php>

The key variable in this data set, weight, is a function of the site
location and the number and types of predators.
