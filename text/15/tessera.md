<div class="notes">

I have not had time to preview this software, but it looks very interesting. It takes large problems and converts them to a form for parallel processing not by changing the underlying algorithm, which would be very messy, but by splitting the data into subsets, analyzing each subset, and recombining these results. Such a method "Divide and Recombine" should work well for some analysis, but perhaps not so well for others. It is based on the R programming language. If I get a chance to work with this software, I'll let you know what I think.
