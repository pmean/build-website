A while back, I set up a publication list in Google Scholar. It tracks
the number of citations received by each article that I published. One
of my articles has a massive 287 citations. I'm not the first author on
this or on an of the other articles that received 100+ citations. So I'm
mostly riding on the coattails of some very good
researchers.
