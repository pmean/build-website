I'm ordinarily not a big fan of commercial software, but one product
that I would have a hard time living without is MathType. It produces
mathematical equations with ease and the appearance is almost always
perfect. It's hard to do this, especially with equations have lots of
superscripts and subscripts. You get the size or spacing wrong and all
of a sudden things look really ugly and it is hard to fix. TeX is a very
good product, too, but I have grown so used to MathType that it is
really hard to make the switch.<U+00A0> I had to upgrade MathType recently to
version 6.9 and I wanted to experiment with MathType equations on my
blog. Here are some examples.

Here's a simple equation related to something called the power prior.

This is the default option, which saves the file at 96 dots per inch
(dpi). The letters are a bit fuzzy.

Here's the same equation where the default file is saved at 120 dpi.
It's a bit cleaner, but seems a bit out of proportion with the regular
text.

The default options under "Other" is 300 dpi and it looks sharp and
crisp, but way too large.

One final choice is 240 dpi (see above). Again, way too big. This choice
actually, though, works well for PowerPoint where the font sizes are so
much larger.
