A lot of people have adapted and updated the CONSORT Guidelines to
reporting clinical trials to handle other types of research. One of
these adaptations is the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting animal
research. Many of these guidelines follow CONSORT quite closely, but
there are details, such as documenting the species and strain of the
experimental animals and describing the housing conditions, that are
specific to animal experiments.
