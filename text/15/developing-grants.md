<div class="notes">

This article provides guidance for developing the "statistical considerations" section of a research grant. I normally do not use that term, and suggest separate sections on statistical methods, sample size justification, data management plan, etc. But that's a quibble. This is very good practical advice, such as reminding you that you need to write both for the statistical reviewer and the non-statistician who is also reviewing the proposal.
