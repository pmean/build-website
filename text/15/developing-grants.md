This article provides guidance for developing the "statistical
considerations" section of a research grant. I normally do not use that
term, and suggest separate sections on statistical methods, sample size
justification, data management plan, etc. But that's a quibble. This is
very good practical advice, such as reminding you that you need to write
both for the statistical reviewer and the non-statistician who is also
reviewing the proposal.
