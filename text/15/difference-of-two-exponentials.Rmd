I wanted to provide an overview of how you analyze a classic nonlinear regression model. It is a difference of two exponential functions. This nonlinear function is used commonly in pharmocokinetic models and is a simply way to model the oral administration of a drug. I want to show how the model works in a mathematical sense and then how you fit it using R.

Here are some simple examples of nonlinear regression. We will use the built-in data set Theoph for all our examples.

```{r difference-in-two-exponentials-01}
head(Theoph)
```

```{r difference-in-two-exponentials-02}
tail(Theoph)
```
