**[StATS]:** **Searching the literature (May 3,
2005)**

Next week, our hospital will have a seminar on Reiki. I thought it would
be useful to see what evidence there was on this technique. My search
included access to several resources through a system called Ovid.
Unfortunately, Ovid requires a fee, so it is not available to the
general public. There are free sources of information, but these are
scattered around and provide less comprehensive coverage than Ovid. For
example, the site [www.cohrane.org](http://www.cohrane.org) offers you
the abstracts, but not the full text of the Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews.

My search was a bit ill focused, unfortunately. Normally, when you do a
search, you specify four things:

- P = patient group or problem
- I = intervention
- C = comparison intervention or group
- O = outcome

but since I am just curious about Reiki in general, I only have the I
part of PICO defined. It would be better to ask a question like:

In adults with lower back pain (P), does the use of Reiki therapy (I)
compared to physical massage (C) affect the patient's self report of
pain?

There are several good guides to the PICO format:

- <http://www.cebm.net/focus_quest.asp>
- <http://www.pico.at/PICO.HTM>
- <http://library.downstate.edu/EBM2/pico.htm>
- <http://www4.umdnj.edu/camlbweb/ebm/picomodel.htm>

It's a good idea to start at the highest level of the evidence
hierarchy and work your way down. So I went first to the Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews and looked for any review including the
word "Reiki."

There were five reviews, but none of these looked helpful. Two of them
used Reiki as an exclusion criteria and the other three allowed Reiki as
a cointervention but did not evaluate its effects.

Then I went to an Ovid link to "All EBM Reviews - Cochrane DSR, ACP
Journal Club, DARE, and CCTR." A search here yielded 16 links including
the five I had found earlier.

Several results looked promising:

- EBM Reviews - ACP Journal Club Review: "Distant healing" is often
effective for improving patient outcomes \[Therapeutics\] ACP
Journal Club. v133(3):107, November/December, 2000.
- EBM Reviews - Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects Centre for

The first two are critical reviews of a paper:

- Astin JA, Harkness E, Ernst E. The efficacy of "distant healing":
a systematic review of randomized trials. Ann Intern Med. 2000 Jun
6;132:903-10.

that looks at several therapies including Reiki. You can get a [pdf
version of this paper](http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/132/11/903.pdf)
but when you read this paper, it turns out that none of the papers
selected for this systematic review incorporated the practice of Reiki.

All of the remaining links refer to single trials, so I put them on hold
for now to see if I could something broader instead.

A peek at the National Guideline Clearinghouse (free to the public at
[www.guidelines.gov](http://www.guidelines.gov)) yielded no hits on
"Reiki." I did not hold out a lot of hope here, because this is a
resource better suited when you have a well defined patient population
that you need to manage. Since I am totally missing the P portion of
PICO, I am at a serious disadvantage here.

A review of the Best Bets website (www.bestbets.org \-- please don't
put a .com here because it will lead to a gambling site), also yielded
no publications relating to Reiki.

Then I went to PubMed. A search for "Reiki" with a limit of
publication type to meta-analysis yielded two publications, both of
which focused on therapeutic touch rather than Reiki.

- Peters RM. The effectiveness of therapeutic touch: a meta-analytic
review. Nurs Sci Q. 1999 Jan;12(1):52-61. PMID: 11847652
- Winstead-Fry P, Kijek J. An integrative review and meta-analysis of
therapeutic touch research. Altern Ther Health Med. 1999
Nov;5(6):58-67. PMID: 10550906

A search without limits yielded 381 articles, too many to skim through.

It may be time to think about single randomized trials again, so I reran
the "Reiki" search with publication type of randomized clinical
trials. This yielded 28 references, most of which talked about
therapeutic touch rather than Reiki.

I was curious why I was getting so many articles about therapeutic
touch. It turns out that Medline apparently lumps Reiki in with
therapeutic touch as a MeSH term. To look for references that use the
word "Reiki" rather than the MeSH term associated with Reiki, you need
to use \[tw\], the text word tag.

If you do a search on "Reiki \[tw\]" without any limits, you get 52
articles rather than 381. Now restrict this list to publication type of
randomized controlled trial, and you get six references. Most of these
are articles that we found earlier.

psychological depression and self-perceived stress. Altern Ther

So what did I learn? There may be a few good systematic reviews out
there, though they seem to focus on therapeutic touch rather than Reiki.
There are a handful of randomized trials out there that mention Reiki
directly instead of therapeutic touch. I have not had time to critically
appraise any of these articles.

Postscript (May 4, 2005): I asked for some comments and suggestions from
the Evidence Based Health mailgroup, and got two responses right away.
One person pointed out an evidence based review
