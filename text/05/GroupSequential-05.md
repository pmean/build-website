It is very expensive to purchase software that performs group sequential
monitoring of clinical trials (sometimes called interim analysis). Group
sequential monitoring is looking at a trial at selected time points
during the study to see if you should stop the study early. There are a
couple of functions in R that will do simple calculations, and the
price, of course, is free.

The [HMisc library created by Frank
Harrell](http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/Hmisc.html)
has a function ldBands that uses the Lan-DeMets method with flexible
alpha spending functions.

The [seqmon library created by David A.
Schoenfeld](http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/seqmon.html)
has a seqmon function that uses the algorithm by Amitage, McPherson and
Rowe. An example they cite shows boundaries using the O'Brien Fleming
approach.

I will try to document some of the details of these algorithms and test
them against some well known examples when I have time.
