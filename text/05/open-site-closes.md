**[StATS]:** **Another open site closes (May 23,
2005)**

I often link to interesting resources on the web, and it is always
distressing to find that content which had been available freely is now
available only through subscription or through membership in a
professional society. This breaks all the links I have on my web pages
and there is no way to fix these links. When you are providing
educational examples to a broad audience, you cannot assume that most of
your readers belong to a particular scientific or medical society or
that they subscribe to a particular journal or magazine.

The economics of providing free content on the web are difficult, of
course, and I can't fault someone for trying to earn a dollar for their
hard work. I just wish there was a way to help out people like me who
have relied on these sources and suddenly have to come up with
replacements for all these links. Perhaps these sites could keep
existing content free, but offer any future content only to paying
customers.

American Medical News (amednews.com). which is published by the American
Medical Association, is the latest group to take free content off of the
web and offer it only to paying customers. Here are six articles from
American Medical News that I had cited (or planned to cite) on various
parts of these web pages. You and I will have to learn to live without
these excellent resources:

Take a look at these links now, because they will disappear sometime in
June.

I am trying my best to only use sources that are freely available, and
sources that I expect to remain freely available in the foreseeable
future.
