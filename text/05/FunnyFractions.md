On my [web page about odds ratios](../journal/oddsratio.asp), I point
out the fractions are funny and cite some well known examples of how
fractions behave in a counter intuitive fashion. One of the examples I
cite is a Car Talk Puzzler problem about a 100 pound sack of potatoes. 
I cited the puzzler book that Tom and Ray Magliozzi had published:

-   **A Haircut in Horse Town: And Other Great Car Talk
    Puzzlers.** (1999) Tom Magliozzi, Ray Magliozzi, Douglas Berman. New
    York NY: Berkley Publishing Group.

but you can also find this question and answer on the web at

    and
-   <http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzler/transcripts/199626/answer.html>

Just recently, the Car Talk guys published another examples of how
fractions are funny. It is a simpler example, but it is still
interesting. One year National Public Radio decides to give Tom a 10%
raise and Ray a 10% pay cut (for PPP \-- Poor Puzzler Performance). The
following year, Tom gets the 10% pay cut and Ray gets a 10% raise. They
ask who ends up with more money.

The answer is surprising, not in who gets more money but the fact that
both of them are making less money after two years, even though they
seemed to get offsetting pay raises and pay cuts. The full details of
this puzzler question and answer are at

    and
-   <http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzler/transcripts/200549/answer.html>

The fact that a 10% raise and 10% pay cut do not offset one another may
not be immediately apparent, but when you consider a more extreme case,
a 100% pay raise and a 100% pay cut, it becomes more apparent.
