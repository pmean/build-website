A recent query on the IRB Forum
asked about a pilot study. The goal of the pilot study was to see if
different ways of presenting the materials would lead to an improvement
in the response rate among participants. The researchers wanted to
withhold information about the purpose of the pilot study from the
participants because it might bias their response. The writer of the
query was a member of the IRB that wanted some comments about whether it
is okay to withhold this information and if patients should be told if
they are participating in the pilot phase of the research.

Withholding information is commonly done and accepted in research. For
example, in a blinded study, you withhold information about which
treatment a patient is getting until after the study is completed.

You should never withhold information about the risks of participation,
of course, and the subjects need to understand the general purpose of
the study. That can be easily assured here. In this particular example,
I see no need to inform patients about the specific goals of the pilot
study, but I do not think it would harm things to tell them that they
are participating in the pilot phase of the research. Most people should
understand what a pilot phase is, but you could include a general
definition (a pilot study is an effort to evaluate the research methods
in a small group of patients to see if there are any problems or issues
that need to be resolved prior to the start of the full study) in the
consent form if you like.

Note that withholding information is not quite the same thing as
deception, though the line dividing the two concepts is somewhat vague.
Sometimes deception about the purpose of a study is necessary to avoid
bias in the research. For example, you want to find out how patients
react to an environment that is constructed to produce stress. If you
tell people that the purpose of the study is to look at reactions to
stress, they will gird themselves up for the anticipated stress and may
produce results that are not representative of their true reactions.
Studies involving deception require very careful scrutiny. The
guidelines of the American Psychology Association discuss this issue:

*8.07 Deception in Research (a) Psychologists do not conduct a study
involving deception unless they have determined that the use of
deceptive techniques is justified by the study's significant
prospective scientific, educational, or applied value and that
effective nondeceptive alternative procedures are not feasible. (b)
Psychologists do not deceive prospective participants about research
that is reasonably expected to cause physical pain or severe emotional
distress. (c) Psychologists explain any deception that is an integral
feature of the design and conduct of an experiment to participants as
early as is feasible, preferably at the conclusion of their
participation, but no later than at the conclusion of the data
collection, and permit participants to withdraw their data. (See also
Standard 8.08, Debriefing.)*
