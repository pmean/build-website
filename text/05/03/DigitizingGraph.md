**[StATS]:** **Digitizing a graph (March 15,
2005)**. [Category: Data management](../category/DataManagement.html)

> Someone brought me a graph with a trend line relating body surface
> area (BSA) to various cardiac measurements. This graph showed both the
> trend line and limits at +/-2 standard deviations and +/-3 standard
> deviations. She asked if I could write a program based on that graph
> that would allow her to input a patient\'s BSA and cardiac measures
> and get a Z-score in return.
>
> My first step was to scan in the image. I tried various resolutions,
> and it looks like 300 dpi worked reasonably well. Here is a portion of
> the image that I scanned (reduced to one third the original size to
> fit easily on this web page).

> Notice that there is a marked tilt to these graphs.
>
> Then I imported the data into Photoshop Elements. I rotated the graphs
> by small increments until I got an image where the gridlines appeared
> roughly vertical and horizontal. Then I noted the physical location of
> the four corners of each graph (actually, since the right hand side of
> the graph extends slightly beyond 2.0, I used the co-ordinate 2.0,0.6
> instead of the upper right hand corner and 2.0, 0.0 instead of the
> lower right hand corner.
>
> Then I noted the physical location of a limited number ofÂ  data points
> on the trend line itself as well as at +/- 2 SD and +/- 3 SD. You then
> get three estimates of the trend line (the line itself, a value
> halfway between the +2 SD and -2 SD lines, and a value halfway between
> the +3 and -3 SD lines. These values were reasonably consistent, so I
> averaged them.
>
> The digitized values also provided four estimates of the standard
> deviation (one-third the difference between the +3 SD line and the
> trend line, etc.). Again these values were reasonably consistent so I
> averaged them.
>
> The trend line was well approximated by a quartic polynomial
> regression model, and the standard deviation was well approximated by
> a linear regression model. I then programmed the results into a simple
> Excel spreadsheet.
>
> There is software out there that will do this sort of thing
> automatically.

> screen mode on a 640 by 480 pixel monitor. This told me that it would
