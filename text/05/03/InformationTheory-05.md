**[StATS]:** **More on information theory models
(March 24, 2005)**

Some of the people I work with have used information theory extensively
in their work. A good summary of their efforts appears in

-   **Automated splicing mutation analysis by information theory.**
    Nalla VK, Rogan PK. Hum Mutat 2005: 25(4); 334-342.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=15776446&dopt=Abstract)
    [\[Abstract\]](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/110431165/ABSTRACT)
    [\[PDF\]](http://www.sce.umkc.edu/~roganp/Information/articles/humu20040428final),
    and
-   **Information analysis of human splice site mutations.** Rogan PK,
    Faux BM, Schneider TD. Human Mutation 1998: 12(3); 153-71.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9711873&dopt=Abstract)
    [\[PDF\]](http://www.sce.umkc.edu/~roganp/Information/articles/rogan_humu_1998.pdf)

and they have a website with software, <https://splice.cmh.edu>. You
need to register on the site to use the software, but the registration
is free.

My pages on Information Theory are at:

-   [Information theory model](../model/information.asp)
-   [Information theory model](../model/InfoModel.htm) (alternate
    version of the same page)
-   [Definition:
    Entropy](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/entropy.htm)
-   [More on information theory models (August
    31, 2004)](http://www.childrensmercy.org/stats/weblog2004/information1.asp)
-   [Information theory models (May
    11, 2004)](http://www.childrensmercy.org/stats/weblog2004/information.asp)

but they need to be consolidated and updated.
