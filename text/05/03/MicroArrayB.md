**[StATS]:** **More articles on microarrays (March
10, 2005)**.

It\'s impossible to keep up with the flood of research on microarrays,
but here are a few articles published in the journal, Statistical
Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology that sounded interesting.
This journal, unfortunately, does not offer full free text on the web.

-   Conrad J. Burden, Yvonne E. Pittelkow, and Susan R. Wilson (2004)
    \"Statistical Analysis of Adsorption Models for Oligonucleotide
    Microarrays\", Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular
    Biology: Vol. 3: No. 1, Article 35.

    Parmigiani (2004) \"MergeMaid: R Tools for Merging and Cross-Study
    Validation of Gene Expression Data\", Statistical Applications in
