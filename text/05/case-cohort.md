During a consultation about an NIH research grant, the term "case cohort design" came up. The Case Cohort design is similar to a nest Case Control design, but also has some important differences.

Here are two published examples of a Case Cohort design:

- Folsom AR, Nieto FJ, McGovern PG, Tsai MY, Malinow MR, Eckfeldt JH, Hess DL, Davis CE. Prospective study of coronary heart disease incidence in relation to fasting total homocysteine, related genetic polymorphisms, and B vitamins: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Circulation 1998: 98(3); 204-10. Available in [html format][fol1] or [pdf format][fol2].

When I get the time, I will prepare a formal definition of these two terms.
