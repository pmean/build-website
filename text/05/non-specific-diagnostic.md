**[StATS]:** **A nonspecific diagnostic test
(October 13, 2005)**

Someone posted a note on the IRBFORUM complaining that the IRB was
preventing him/her from volunteering for a test. This company has a
very promising "non-intrusive Universal Early Cancer Detection test"
but the company could not take any volunteers before getting IRB
approval. There were a lot of good comments, but one thing that caught
my eye in a later email was the following claim:

*Besides, the test itself is non-intrusive: they will take 2 micro
liter samples of blood and within 3 hours we get our results on any
type of 1\_week\_or\_older cancer.*

This claims illustrates a very important point: research claims which
lack specificity also lack credibility. A treatment that claims to
cure everything probably cures nothing.

Specificity was one of the nine conditions that Sir Bradford Hill
developed in 1965 to argue when the evidence was persuasive enough to
establish a causal link. There are a few limited exceptions (aspirin
is helpful for a wide range of conditions) but the principle has stood
the test of time.

Let's look again at the original claim. This diagnostic test can
detect ANY type of cancer. That's certainly possible, but extremely
unlikely. The ways that breast cancer, melanoma, leukemia, prostate
cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer, etc. progress are quite
different, and it extremely unlikely that a diagnostic test could find
the single biomarker that was common to all these types of cancer,
because that biomarker probably does not exist.

The claim is even more non-specific than that, though. The test,
apparently, can detect cancer that is only ONE WEEK OLD. That is a
rather amazing claim if you think about it. Most one week old tumors
are microscopic, I suspect, but this test is claimed to be sensitive
enough to detect even these tumors.

There are other technical issues worth discussing, such as the
possibility that this test will confuse benign and malignant tumors,
but the bottom line is that a diagnostic test that claims to detect
any type of tumor, even one week old tumors, is probably worthless.

Now, I have no problem with letting these scientists test their
product (carefully and ethically, of course). If they are right and I
am wrong, then they can quote my email and laugh at me when they claim
their Nobel Prize. But based on past experience, claims that are
overly broad usually represent either delusional thinking or the use
of highly biased research samples.
