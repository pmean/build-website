Vital to the ethical conduct of a clinical trial is the concept of
equipoise, that a researcher is clinically indifferent or genuinely
uncertain, as to whether a new therapy is better than the standard
therapy.

Stephen Senn is a harsh critic of the concept of equipoise and points
out the reality that most researchers go into a study with a belief that
the new therapy being tested is better.

> *Equipoise is an irrelevance. Patients are entered onto the trial
> because the trialists believe that the experimental treatment is
> better. The control group treatment should be as good as that
> available outside the trial. Experimentation continues until either
> the trialists are convinced they are wrong (equipoise is reached) or
> they convince Society they are right.* \-- [Senn
> (2000)](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/321/7258/442#9231).

The FDA comments on equipoise are less extreme than Dr. Senn\'s but
still echo the same sentiment.

I had included both of these quotes before in a web page about placebos,
but I did not realize until just now that this is in diametric
opposition to a claim by Djulbegovic

Perhaps this 74/26 split is a reflection, not of publication bias, not
of choice of inappropriate controls, but rather the intelligence of the
research planners who work for commercial sponsors. This is not to say
that publication bias does not exist, or that bad controls are not
sometimes deliberately chosen. It\'s just that if I were a drug company,
I would want to hire people who, because of their intuition and good
sense, investigate new drugs that have a good chance of actually
working.
