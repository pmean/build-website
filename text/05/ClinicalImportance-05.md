Many journal authors have the bad habit of looking just at the p-value
of a study and ignoring the clinical importance of their findings. If
they get a small p-value, which indicates a statistically significant
difference between the new therapy and the standard therapy, they dance
in the streets, they pop open the champagne bottles, they celebrate
wildly, and they publish their results in an \"A\" journal. If they get
a large p-value, they rend their clothes, they throw ashes on their
heads, they wail and moan, and they publish their results in a \"C\"
journal.

An article about measurement of fatigue

-   **Measurement of Fatigue Determining Minimally Important Cllinical
    Differences.** Schwartz AL, Meek PM, Nail LM, Fargo J, Lundquist M,
    Donofrio M, Grainger M, Throckmorton T, Mateo M. Journal of Clinical
    Epidemiology 2002: 55(3); 239 - 244.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11864794)

offers some valuable lessons about clinically relevant differences.

Cancer patients have major problems with fatigue. The only good measure
is a self-report, and this can be measured in several different ways:

-   Profile of Mood States, a 65 item scale with a subscale of five
    items representing fatigue. Each item is rated from 0 to 4.
-   Schwartz Cancer Fatigue Scale, a 28 item scale with four subscales:
    physical, emotional, cognitive, and temporal. Each item is rated
    from 0 to 4.
-   General Fatigue Scale a ten item scale with no subscales. Each item
    is rated from 1 to 10.
-   A ten point single item scale.

The last scale asked the question \"what is your level of fatigue
today\" with 0 representing \"no fatigue\" and 10 representing \"the
greatest possible fatigue.\" There\'s a slight error here, because if
you count properly, there are 11 numbers in the range from 0 to 10.

The researchers measured a group of 103 cancer patients before and after
initiation of chemotherapy. In addition to getting the four scales, the
patients were asked at follow-up whether their fatigue levels had
changed and by how much. Interestingly, 30 subjects reported a decrease
in fatigue, but the average scores on all four scales for these patients
did not differ from their peers who reported no change in fatigue. Those
who reported an increase in fatigue did differ from those reporting no
change. What this means is difficult to interpret, but the authors feel
that patients may perceive increases in fatigue differently than
decreases in fatigue.

If you look at the average change in each scale for those patients who
report a small change in fatigue, this represents a minimally important
clinical difference. The numbers don\'t seem to quite match the tables,
but the authors suggest that a 5.6 unit shift in POMS, 5.0 for SCFS, 9.7
for GFS, and 2.4 for the single item scale. If you divide each of these
values by the number of items in the scale, you get values that hover
around 1.0 for the first three scales, which is similar to a recently
published paper in BMJ.
