> ***A Visit to the ER from St. Nick***
>
> *Twas the night before surgery, and all 'cross the floor\
> The patients were buzzing 'bout the guy in Room Four.\
> His chart was hung on his door with great care\
> To make sure his name was not shown anywhere.*
>
> *The patients were nestled all snug in their beds\
> While telemetry monitors beeped overhead.\
> And I in my gown, with its crack in the back,\
> Had just settled down for my clear liquid snack.*
>
> *When down the hall there arose such a clatter,\
> I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.\
> I pulled off my leads and flew out the door,\
> With my IV pole dragging behind on the floor.*
>
> *Away to Room Four I hurriedly dashed\
> Unaware of my gown and the nurses I flashed.\
> As I slid to a halt and leaned to peek in\
> I heard the nurse say, "Sir, you mustn't go in!"*
>
> *And what did I see when I looked in Bed A\
> But ole Mr. Claus; on his belly he lay.\
> Covered in gauze and stuck high in the air\
> Oh what a sight, 'twas St. Nick's derriere!*
>
> *He was yelling at Doris, the nurse at his side\
> To be tied to this bed, he just could not abide.\
> He moaned and he bellowed about his ill luck\
> But there was just nothing for it; the old man was stuck.*
>
> *"What happened to Santa?" to Doris I said,\
> "Why's he on his belly in this hospital bed?"\
> With a grin she whispered, "He did something stupid.\
> He injured his butt when he backed into Cupid."*
>
> *But the old man's ears were sharp as tack.\
> He heard what she said there behind his back.\
> "You had no right to speak, and that is a fact!\
> Don't you know about HIPAA, the privacy act?"*
>
> *"You're out of compliance, Doris, my dear.\
> You had no right to tell him 'bout my injured rear!\
> I'll sue you for breach, and this hospital, too!\
> You won't have a job when I'm through with you!"*
>
> *"When I check my list and then check it twice,\
> You'll be in the column labeled 'Not Nice.'\
> The HIPAA patrol will likewise drop by\
> To find out why you, Doris, did not comply!"*
>
> *"They'll want to know why you opened your yap,\
> A big, hefty fine on your butt they will slap.\
> And from me every Christmas you will now see\
> Nothing but switches and coal 'neath your tree."*
>
> *Merry Christmas and HIPAA New Year!*
