**[StATS]:** **Moderator variables (February 15,
2005)**.

I\'ve always disliked the excessive use of detailed terminology, but
when someone asked me about moderator variables, I had to look up the
details. Basically, a moderator variable is one that interacts with the
exposure or treatment variable. It effectively forces you to qualify
your findings. Here\'s a published example with abstract (I have not
read the full article):

-   **The relation between locus of control and coping in two contexts:
    age as a moderator variable.** Blanchard-Fields F, Irion JC. Psychol
    Aging 1988: 3(2); 197-203.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=3268260&dopt=Abstract)
    *We examined the relation between locus of control and coping as
    moderated by age and context. A total of 96 adolescents, young
    adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults were administered
    Lazarus\'s Ways of Coping questionnaire, a situation-specific
    controllability measure, a defensive coping questionnaire, and
    Levenson\'s Internality, Powerfulness of Others, and Chance global
    locus of control scales for challenging and threatening contexts.
    Age moderated the relation between locus of control and coping.
    Internality was positively related to escape-avoidance, hostile
    reaction, and self-blame for younger individuals and negatively
    related for older adults. A belief in powerfulness of others was
    positively related to planful problem-solving and self-controlling
    in older adults and negatively related for younger individuals.
    Finally, a belief in chance was positively related to distancing and
    self-controlling for older adults and negatively related for younger
    individuals. The implication that dimensions of control vary with
    age is discussed.*

As you can see, the relationship between locus of control and coping is
quite different for younger individuals compared to older individuals.

Some web resources that offer definitions of moderator variables are:

-   [www.psych.ubc.ca/\~schaller/Baron1986.pdf](http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Baron1986.pdf)

There are additional terms used in the research literature such as
mediator variable and intervening variable. I generally try to avoid
using these terms, and even shy away from the commonly used term
\"confounding variable.\"
