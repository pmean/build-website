> An example of this involves the normalization of Affymetrix microarray
> chips. The Affy chips as they are often called, use photolithography
> to build the chip, a process similar to the approach used to create
> semiconductor chips. This approach allows a very high number of genes
> to be tested on a slide that can fit in the palm of your hand. Unlike
> spotted arrays, that places spots of the full sequence of the gene (or
> Expressed Sequence Tag) on a slide, the Affy chip selects 20 probes
> for each gene, each of which has a length of 25 base pairs. Next to
> each of these probes is another probe that represents the same 25 base
> pair sequence except that the middle base is changed. The 20 probes
> are called PM (Perfect Match) probes and the probes with the changed
> middle base are called MM (MisMatch) probes. The MM probes are an
> attempt to measure and control for cross-hbridization, the tendency
> for genese that are similar, but not identical to a particular gene
> sequence to bind weakly to these sites.

> Affymetrix has developed an algorithm, MAS5, that adjusts the PM
> probes by effectively subtracting the signal found on the MM probes.
> This subtraction is done carefully to avoid producing negative signals
> and to minimize the effect of outliers. Most of the data I have
> received from Affy chips has used MAS5 to summarize the 20 PM and MM
> probes to produce a single intensity value for each gene.
