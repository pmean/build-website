**[StATS]:** **More on regular expressions (July 21,
2005)** [Category: Data management](../category/DataManagement.html)

As I work more and more with microarrays, the more I realize that having
a knowledge of regular expressions will help. For example, I had a comma
separated file (.CSV) and it had an extra comma at the end of every
line. I wanted to remove those commas, but not any of the others.

It turns out that my text editor (textpad) will allow search and replace
on regular expressions. So I searched for

-   ,\$

and replaced it with a null string. The dollar sign says to match a
string only if it is at the end of a line. If I had wanted to replace
any commas that begin a line of text, I could have searched for

-   \^,
