I tried a pilot experiment of a quality control exercise. It seemed to
go fairly well. The goal of the exercise was to flip a coin from a table
onto a target on the floor below.

This blurry picture is a recreation of the exercise. A measurer would
then note the distance from the penny to the target.

The team had 20 practice flips and then had to write an SOP (standard
operating procedure). This was a bit confusing to the team, so I pointed
out that they needed to specify the location of the launch point, the
location of the target, etc.

After they wrote down an SOP for the coin flip, I asked them to run 20
trials and record the distances from the target. Here is the graph of
the results, rather crudely drawn. I drew the graph because there were
only two team members in my pilot exercise.

As you can see, the graph doesn't need to be fancy. After these 20
trials, I asked the team if they could think of a way to improve the
process. This was not easy for them to do, but finally they suggested
changing the penny to an object that wouldn't bounce around so much
after initial impact. Most of the coin flips landed close enough but
then bounced further away. They ended up using a sugar packet. The graph
of their next 20 trials appears below.

This entire experiment took about 30 minutes. With a bit more time, I
would discuss the computation of a center line and control limits.

Here's a draft outline of what I am submitting to the organizers of
this seminar. Hopefully, it will give you an idea of how I plan to work
this example into my training class

**Session Content**: A hands-on team exercise will encourage you
[i.e., the students] to define a simple work process, collect data
on that process, try to improve that process, and then measure the
success (or lack of success) in your improvement. Then we will cover
the three steps needed to establish a quality control program in your
laboratory. Finally, you will learn how to calculate limits for a
control chart.

**Instructional methods**: small group exercises and didactic
lectures.

**Performance objectives**: In this class, you will learn how to:
identify the three steps needed to implement a quality control
program, collect data on a simple work process, graph the trends in
that work process to identify trends, and compute control limits to
separate common and special cause variation.
