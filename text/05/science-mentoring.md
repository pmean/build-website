**[StATS]:** **Science mentoring (September 12,
2005)**

I received an email notice through the Kansas/Western Missouri chapter
of the American Statistical Association about "Meet the Science Mentor
Day." This is a half day workshop in the Kansas City area that allows
students working<U+FFFD> to talk to professional scientists to get advice on
possible science fair projects. Apparently, they would like some of the
mentors to have backgrounds in Statistics, Probability, Research Design,
and data management. If you are in the Kansas City area, this might be
an interesting thing to work on. More details about "Meet the Science
Mentor Day" is on the web at
