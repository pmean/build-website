**[StATS]:** **Quality control exercises (created
2005-09-01)**.

I\'ve taught several courses on Quality Control, and the best part is
the practice exercises.

At the [American Society of Andrology\'s lab workshop in
2005](http://www.andrologysociety.com/meetings/alw.program2005.asp), I
used a blind paper cutting exercise described in

-   Stone, Richard A. (1998) The blind paper cutter: Teaching about
    variation, bias, stability, and process control. The American
    Statistician, 52, 244-247.

It worked very well, and I wanted to use it again for the [2006
workshop](http://www.andrologysociety.com/meetings/future.aspx). But
unfortunately, many of the people attending the new workshop will have
attended the previous workshop. So I have to find a new practice
exercise.

One possible exercise involves the production of paper helicopters. You
cut and fold a sheet of paper so that it has \"helicopter blades\" and
drop it from a fixed height. Measure how long it takes to reach the
ground. Now, the question becomes \"How long and how reliable are the
flight times?\" So you could drop the same helicopter 20 times and draw
a control chart of the results. Alternately, you could try to redesign
the helicopter (wider or thinner blades) to try to optimize the flight
times.

This exercise is described in

-   **Teaching Statistics. A Bag of Tricks.** Gelman A, Nolan D (2002)
    Oxford, England: Oxford University Press. ISBN: 0198572247.

Here is a picture showing how to prepare the helicopter from page 260 of
their book.

Another approach would use a catapult and try to optimize the distance
that the object is thrown. You can buy a very nice catapult that was
designed for this sort of experiment at

but something at a toy store might work reasonably well on a limited
budget.

The cat-a-pult product described in the last link formed the basis of a
team building exercise as described in

-   <http://sbaweb.wayne.edu/~absel/bkl/vol31/31bb.pdf>

Some other possible ideas for quality control exercises might come from

-   Easterling, Robert G. (2004) Teaching experimental design. The
    American Statistician, 58, 244-252.
-   Sparks, Ross S. and Field, John B. F. (2000) Using Deming\'s funnel
    experiment to demonstrate effects of violating assumptions
    underlying Shewhart\'s control charts. The American Statistician,
    54, 291-302.
-   Brady, James E. and Allen, Theodore T. (2002) Case study based
    instruction of DOE and SPC. The American Statistician, 56, 312-315.
-   Lawrance, A. J. (1996) A design of experiments workshop as an
    introduction to statistics.\
    The American Statistician, 50, 156-158.

I have not had a chance to look at these four papers in detail, yet.
