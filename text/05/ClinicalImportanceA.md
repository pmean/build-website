Back in March, I sent a letter to the American Journal of Psychiatry
complaining about their failure to include confidence intervals in their
published reports. The journal decided not to publish this letter, but
since it discusses an important general issue, I thought I would place
the submitted letter here.

The reliance on p-values instead of confidence intervals is a problem in
many medical journals. I submitted a similar letter to BMJ back in 1999,
which they also did not publish, though it did appear in their eletters
section. You can read my submission to BMJ at

Here is the text of that letter:

> *Two very similar studies published back to back in the May 1, 1999
> issue of the British Medical Journal offer an interesting contrast in
> interpretability. Both studies examine an adverse event that might be
> associated with vaccination: type 1 diabetes with Haemophilus
> influenzae type B vaccine (1) and wheezing illnesses with pertussis
> vaccine (2). Both studies use a cohort design. Both studies summarize
> the association using risk ratios. Both studies even include identical
> risk ratios, 1.06, among the risk ratios studied. But one study uses
> p-values to summarize statistical significance and the other uses
> confidence intervals. The study using confidence interval is easier to
> interpret because you can assess the practical significance of the
> findings.\
> \
> You assess practical significance by examining whether the results of
> a study, even after allowing for sampling error, fail to exceed a
> threshold of clinical relevance. The threshold is a change of
> sufficient size to convince you to change your practice.\
> \
> Confidence intervals are valuable for studies that achieve statistical
> significance. With large sample sizes, it is possible to achieve
> statistical significance, even though the results of the study lie
> well within a range of clinical indifference.\
> \
> Confidence intervals are even more valuable for studies that fail to
> demonstrate statistical significance. If the confidence interval is
> sufficiently narrow, then absence of a statistically significant
> effect also implies absence of a clinically relevant effect. The
> narrow interval assures you that this finding could not be caused by
> an inadequate sample size.\
> \
> In the pertussis vaccination article, it is easy to judge practical
> significance because the authors present the statistical summary using
> confidence intervals. For example, the relative risk for intermittent
> wheezing is 1.06 and the 95% confidence interval is 0.81 to 1.37. This
> interval clearly excludes the possibility that vaccination is
> associated with a large relative change in either direction.\
> \
> As a statistician, I am in a poor position to judge how large a risk
> would have to be in order to achieve clinical relevance. Such a
> decision would require medical judgement about the frequency and
> severity of the adverse event, the cost of treating the adverse event,
> and would have to balance this against the benefits of vaccination.
> The decision should examine both relative and absolute changes in
> risk. But suppose an expert decided in this situation that a change in
> clinical practice should only happen for a relative risk smaller than
> 0.67 or larger than 1.5. With this guidance, you have evidence that no
> change in practice is warranted, because the confidence interval in
> the pertussis vaccination article lies entirely inside a range of
> clinical indifference.\
