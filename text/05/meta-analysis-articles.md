I found a couple of interesting articles on meta-analysis that are
difficult to classify:

- **Interpreting epidemiological evidence: how meta-analysis and
causal inference methods are related.** Weed DL. Int J Epidemiol
2000: 29(3); 387-90.
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10869307&dopt=Abstract)
[\[Abstract\]](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/3/387)
[\[Full
text\]](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/29/3/387)
[\[PDF\]](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/29/3/387.pdf)
- **Systematic reviews: a cross-sectional study of location and
citation counts.** Montori VM, Wilczynski NL, Morgan D, Haynes RB.
BMC Med 2003: 1(1); 2.
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=14633274&dopt=Abstract)
[\[Abstract\]](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/1/2/abstract)
[\[Full text\]](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/1/2)
[\[PDF\]](http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1741-7015-1-2.pdf)

The first relates how meta-analysis supports some, but not all of
Hill's criteria for causation. The second compared systematic reviews
with narrative reviews. Systematic reviews were cited more often (26
times on average versus 8) and included twice as many citations.

**\[Update August 23, 2005\]** Here are some articles that I had used as
teaching examples. I have switched to using open source journals because
it is easier to incorporate large sections of text into my web pages and
book with open source publications. These are still interesting
examples, however, and they have full free text on the web.

- **Collaborative Meta-Analysis of Randomised Trials of Antiplatelet
Therapy for Prevention of Death, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke
in High Risk Patients.** Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration.
BMJ 2002: 324(7329); 71-86.
[\[PDF\]](http://bmj.com/cgi/reprint/324/7329/71.pdf)
- **Efficacy, Tolerability, and Upper Gastrointestinal Safety of
Celecoxib for Treatment of Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis:
Systematic Review of Randomised Controlled Trials.** Jonathan J
Deeks, Lesley A Smith, Matthew D Bradley. BMJ 2002: 325(7365);

- **Effect of Iron Supplementation on Incidence of Infectious Illness
in Children: Systematic Review.** Tarun Gera, H P S Sachdev. BMJ
