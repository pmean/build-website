What I originally wrote for this page has been replaced by

- [Stats: Guidelines for meta-analysis
models](../model/metaanalysis.asp)

which gives general guidance about meta-analysis, and

- [Stats: Meta-analysis for a diagnostic
test](../model/diagnostic.asp)

which talks about the particular issues associated with diagnostic
tests. Both pages still need a bit of work.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [original website][sim2].
