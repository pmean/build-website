Chance News has changed recently to a Wiki format.

*Chance News reviews current issues in the news that use probability
or statistical concepts. Its aim is to give the general public a
better understanding of chance news as reported by the media and to
allow teachers of probability and statistics courses to liven up their
courses with current news. From 1992 to 2004, Chance News was written
by a small number of regular contributors. These are archived on the
[Chance Website][cha1] where
you will also find Outside resources for teaching a probability or
statistic course.*

*Chance News is now a collaborative effort of its readers in the
spirit of the very successful free [encyclopedia Wikipedia][wik1].
The Wikimedia software makes it easy to add new items, or to modify
existing items. For this you need to create an account and login. (See
the top of any page). It is not necessary to login to read Chance
News. Chance News will continue to be freely available under the GNU
Free Documentation License.*

The new ChanceWiki is available [here][cha2], and I decided to offer a contribution, based on one of my weblog entries
(Allegations of scientific misconduct). This
entry is placed in the public domain and others are allowed to freely
edit this material. You can view my contribution [here][cha3].

I'll make a few editing changes and additions over time, and it is
possible that others may edit or add information as well. Editing, of
course, could be as minor as fixing my spelling but it could go all the
way to wholesale deletion of the entire article if the other
contributors to ChanceWiki don't like it.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [original website][sim2].
