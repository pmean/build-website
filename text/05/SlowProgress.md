**[StATS]:** **Slow progress on my weblog (November
25, 2005)**. [Category: Website
details](../category/WebsiteDetails.html)

> You may have noticed how few entries there are in the month of
> November. That's just a reflection of the extraordinary surge in work
> here at Children's Mercy Hospital. There's lots of things that I
> wanted to write for this weblog, but there just isn't any free time
> recently. I'm hoping that things settle down to a more normal pace
> soon and I can get back to writing an entry here every other day or
> so.
