**[StATS]:** **Slow progress on my weblog (November
25, 2005)**. [Category: Website
details](../category/WebsiteDetails.html)

> You may have noticed how few entries there are in the month of
> November. That\'s just a reflection of the extraordinary surge in work
> here at Children\'s Mercy Hospital. There\'s lots of things that I
> wanted to write for this weblog, but there just isn\'t any free time
> recently. I\'m hoping that things settle down to a more normal pace
> soon and I can get back to writing an entry here every other day or
> so.
