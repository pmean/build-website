Someone wrote to me with a statement that represents a commonly held,
but false belief. He stated, in effect, that a p-value of 0.06 means
that there is only a 6% probability that the null hypothesis is true.

While the p-value is indeed a probability, it represents effectively a
probability about the data, given that the null hypothesis is true. The
statement above is effective a statement about the probability that the
null hypothesis is true, given the data. It\'s a rather subtle reversal
of a conditional probability, but one with important ramifications.

The only way that you can compute a probability for the null hypothesis
is to use Bayesian statistics. This involve specifying a prior
probability for the null hypothesis, something that is quite
controversial.

Bayesians delight in computing things like the probability that the sun
will rise tomorrow. It takes a different way of looking at things, but I
have found that the Bayesian approach becomes more attractive for some
of the more complex problems in Statistics.

I have a bibliography of references on [p-values (and confidence
intervals)](../library/pvalueci1.asp), and have made a feeble attempt to
accumulate a [few references about Bayesian
statistics](../library/bayesian.asp). When I get the time, I would like
to write a page on some simple Bayesian models. There is an entire
software program devoted to Bayesian analysis, BUGS (Bayesian inference
Using Gibbs Sampling):

The [Edstat-l
listserv](http://www.lsoft.com/scripts/wl.exe?SL1=EDSTAT-L&H=LISTS.PSU.EDU)
has had an active debate about the weaknesses of p-values and null
hypothesis significance testing starting in late December.
