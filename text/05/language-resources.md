Once in a while, I will get an email or find a website written in a
foreign language. The best way to handle this is through BabelFish:

- **[Babelfish Translation](http://babelfish.altavista.com/%20)**.
AltaVista. Accessed on 2002-10-23. babelfish.altavista.com/

Google also has a translation site:

- [www.google.com/language\_tools?hl=en](http://www.google.com/language_tools?hl=en)

The New York Times had an article today (Fitzgerald, T. J. (2005).
Language Anxiety? Try Immersion Therapy. The New York Times) about web
sites that also help with translation, vocabulary, and learning a
foreign language. It listed the following sources

- [www.colby.edu/\~bknelson/exercises](http://www.colby.edu/~bknelson/exercises)
- [www.berlitz.us/online](http://www.berlitz.us/online)
- [ilovelanguages.com](http://ilovelanguages.com/)

It listed several software vendors as well that offer similar services:

- Rosetta Stone, [www.rosettastone.com](http://www.rosettastone.com)
- Living Language, [transparent.com](http://transparent.com/)
- Auralog, [www.auralog.com](http://www.auralog.com/)
- Instant Immersion, [topics-ent.com](http://topics-ent.com/)
