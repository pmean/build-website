**[StATS]:** **More on the top ten studies in EBM
(February 28, 2005)**

I may never get this paper done, but the effort is still worthwhile in
that I am learning a lot. I rediscovered a wonderful web page developed
by Ben Djulbegovic, [Randomized trials that changed medical
practice](http://www.hsc.usf.edu/~bdjulbeg/oncology/RCT-practice-change.htm),
which along with [Non-randomized trials that changed medical
practice](http://www.hsc.usf.edu/~bdjulbeg/oncology/NON-RCT-practice-change.htm)
lists research studies that have changed how we practice medicine.

The latter page lists several criteria by which you can judge when a
randomized trial would not be needed.

1.  **The Oxford/Sackett \"All or none\" criterion**. When a disease has
    **100% morbidity/mortality prior to the use of an intervention** and
    the intervention now allows some fraction of patients to survive,
    then a randomized trial is not necessary. Alternately, when the
    **morbidity/mortality of a disease drops to 0% after a new therapy
    is introduced**, no randomized trial is necessary.
2.  **The Italian/Nino Cartabellotta crieria:** When a disease has a
    **very high level of morbidity/mortality**, a **large reduction in
    risk** when the therapy is applied, **very few or rare side
    effects**, a convincing **biological mechanism**, and **no
    alternative treatment** is available, then randomized trials are
    unnecessary.
3.  **Nick Black\'s criteria**: These can be summarized in four words:
    **unnecessary, inappropriate, impossible, or inadequate**. When the
    effect is so dramatic that you can rule out any confounding
    variables, so that a randomized trial to balance out these
    covariates is **unnecessary**. Or the outcome is very rare and
    follow-up time is very long so that a randomized trial is
    **inappropriate**. Or strong clinician preference, ethical
    constraints, or legal obstacles make a randomized trial
    **impossible**. Or for the intervention being considered, the low
    external validity of randomized trials makes their use
    **inadequate**.

I\'m not sure of the proper source for the first set of conditions, but
it is similar advice I had heard in [an article by Sir Michale Rawlins
in
Pharamfocus](http://www.pharmafocus.com/cda/focusH/1,2109,22-0-0-0-focus_feature_detail-0-75778,00.html),
though with a caution that the population being studied had to be
homogenous and there had to be a plausible mechanistic explanation for
the therapy.

Nino Cartabellotta and the Italian Group on Evidence Based Medicine
(GIMBE) have several publications in Italian that might be the source of
the second set of conditions.

I suspect that the last set of conditions comes from

-   **What Observational Studies Can Offer Decision Makers**. Black N.
    Horm Res 1999;51(Suppl.1):44-49 (DOI: 10.1159/000053135)
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=10393491)

but I have not seen the full article.

A few highlights from the Randomized trials that changed medical
practice are:

**Historical firsts**. The very first published example of randomization
in a medical trial appears in

-   **Streptomycin treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis**. Medical
    Research Council Streptomycin in Tuberculosis Trials Committee. BMJ
    1948; ii: 769-782.

and showed that streptomycin was superior to bed rest. Actually, a
randomized trial testing the efficacy of immunization against whooping
cough was started first, but did not get reported until 1951.

Two historical perspectives on the streptomycin trial appear in a
special 1998 theme issue of the BMJ celebrating 50 years of progress in
randomized trials:

-   **Controlled trials: the 1948 watershed.** Doll R. British Medical
    Journal 1998: 317(7167); 1217-20.
-   **Use of randomisation in the Medical Research Council\'s clinical
    trial of streptomycin in pulmonary tuberculosis in the 1940s.**
    Yoshioka A. British Medical Journal 1998: 317(7167); 1220-1223.

    [\[PDF\]](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/reprint/317/7167/1220.pdf)

**Folic acid supplementation in pregnant women to prevent spina
bifida**. The Djulbegovic page cites

-   **\[Prevention of the first occurrence of anencephaly and spina
    bifida with periconceptional multivitamin supplementation
    (conclusion)\]** \[Article in Hungarian\]. Czeizel E, Dudas I. Orv
    Hetil. 1994 Oct 16;135(42):2313-7.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=7970646)

This was a large trial where 2471 pregnant women received a multivitamin
supplement including folic acid, and 2391 pregnant women received a
trace-element supplement (copper, manganese, zinc and vitamin C). In the
latter group, six cases of neural-tube defects were found, while none
were found in the folic acid group. Surprisingly<U+FFFD> this was not mentioned
in an [MMWR report published in
1992](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00019479.htm) which
instead cites

-   **Letter to editor**. Czeizel AE, Fritz G. JAMA 1989;262:1634.

probably because it was published in English, as well as

-   **Prevention of neural tube defects: results of the Medical Research
    Council Vitamin Study**. MRC Vitamin Study Research Group. Lancet.
    1991 Jul 20;338(8760):131-7.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=1677062)

Interestingly, a brief news report in Nature in 1982 has the following
abstract:

> *Controversy has erupted in Britain over the ethical implications of
> an impending clinical trial to investigate the role of folic acid and
> other multivitamin supplements in the prevention of neural tube
> defects. The study population will consist of women who had previously
> conceived a spina bifida child and who are now planning another
> pregnancy. Some critics, believing there is already sufficient
> evidence of a folic acid link to spina bifida, object to withholding
> folic acid from one of the high-risk control groups. Concern has also
> been expressed about the extent to which participants will be
> briefed.*

So the concept of equipoise is not a new one.

**Placebo surgery trials.** Two widely cited early randomized double
blind trials for surgery are

-   **An evaluation of internal-mammary-artery ligation by a
    double-blind technic**. Cobb LA, Thomas GI, Dillard DH, Merendino
    KA, Bruce RA. N Engl J Med. 1959 May 28;260(22):1115-8.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=13657350&dopt=Citation)
-   **Comparison of internal mammary artery ligation and sham operation
    for angina pectoris.** Dimond EG, Kittle CF, Crockett JE. Am J
    Cardiol. 1960 Apr;5:483-6.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=13816818&dopt=Citation)

These trials examined a treatment for angina that involved cutting an
artery that leads away from the heart to encourage more blood flow to
the heart itself through the narrowed coronary arteries. While anecdotal
evidence for this procedure accumulated in the 1950s, these two
randomized double blind trials showed that the surgery was ineffective.

These two studies are frequently cited as rationale for use of placebos
and blinding. See, for example,

    response.** Moerman DE, Jonas WB. Ann Intern Med 2002: 136(6);
    471-6.

Again, these trials showed no additional effectiveness of the therapies
over a placebo surgery. A placebo surgery trial is highly controversial,
because patients in the placebo arm undergo all of the risks of surgery,
(side effects of anesthesia, increased chance for infection, side
effects associated with subsequent antibiotic use, etc.).

**CAST trials**. Three drugs, encainide, flecainide, and moricizine,
were thought to prevent heart attacks by suppressing asymptomatic
ventricular arrhythmias (actually, ventricular premature depolarization
or VPD), a condition associated with arrhythmic death. A large scale
randomized trial, however, showed that rather than reducing your risk of
arrhythmic death, these drugs actually increased the risk of death. In
1989, the researchers ended the two arms of the study associated with
encainide and flecainide early because of a higher rate of arrhythmia
deaths, of nonfatal cardiac arrests, and a higher rate of overall
mortality. The study was then redesigned to compare only the third drug,
moricizine, to placebo, with some changes in the entry criteria to
enroll only the more seriously ill patients. This redesigned study,
CAST-II, was also ended early, because of excessive cardiac deaths
during the first two weeks of drug exposure, and a futility analysis.
The futility analysis showed that the current data held out little hope
that additional data would accumulate to the point where there would be
evidence of long term survival.

Why did this happen. One possible explanation is that only a few people
with VPD will die from the condition, limiting the effectiveness of
these drugs, but all those who take these drugs are exposed to potential
side effects. The CAST trials illustrate the important principle that a
change in a surrogate outcome (reduction in VPD) does not always
translate into a reduction in mortality.
