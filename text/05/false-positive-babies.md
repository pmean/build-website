The New York Times had an excellent article on newborn screening tests.

- **Panel to Advise Testing Babies for 29 Diseases.** Kolata G. The
New York Times, February 21, 2005.

Unfortunately, this article is no longer available online. But it
discusses a recent push to standardize and expand the screening tests
for newborns to include 29 different diseases. It seems like such an
obvious thing to do: let's screen for these conditions, because the
more we know, the better we are able to care for these children.

*Proponents say that the diseases are terrible and that an early
diagnosis can be lifesaving. When testing is not done, parents often
end up in a medical odyssey to find out what is wrong with their
child. By the time the answer is in, it may be too late for treatment
to do much good.*

Opponents, however, point out that false positive results may present
more problems.

*But opponents say that for all but about five or six of the
conditions, it is not known whether the treatments help or how often a
baby will test positive but never show signs of serious disease. There
is a danger, they say, of children with mild versions of illnesses
being treated needlessly and aggressively for more serious forms and
suffering dire health consequences.*

The article also offers a historical perspective.

*The history of newborn screening, they say, is filled with cautionary
tales. %22The majority of newborn screening tests have failed,%22 said
Dr. Norman Fost, a professor of pediatrics and director of the program
in medical ethics at the University of Wisconsin. Over the years, Dr.
Fost said, %22thousands of normal kids have been killed or gotten
brain damage by screening tests and treatments that turned out to be
ineffective and very dangerous.%22*

and cites phenylketonuria (PKU) testing as an example.An infant with PKU
cannot metabolize phenylalanine, and the build up of this amino acid can
lead to serious neurological damage. The treatment, a diet low in
phenyalanine, is very effective, but only if the condition is diagnosed
early. The PKU testing done today is very good, but tests performed 45
years ago had problems.

Back then, any infant who tested positive would be put on this special
diet. When phenylalanine is withdrawn from the diet of a healthy infant,
that infant suffers from even more serious neurological problems and can
even die. Many infants who falsely tested positive were put on this diet
and their harms outweighed the benefits of PKU screening. As researchers
learned more, they were able to refine the test to prevent most false
positives, but the damage had already been done.

An additional article about Universal Newborn Hearing Screening (UNHS),

- **The false-positive in universal newborn hearing screening.**
Clemens CJ, Davis SA, Bailey AR. Pediatrics 2000: 106(1); E7.
[\[Abstract\]](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/106/1/e7)
[\[Full
text\]](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/106/1/e7)
[\[PDF\]](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/106/1/e7.pdf)

also discusses the problems with false positives:

*However, support for UNHS is not universal. One of the most
concerning issues raised is the high rate of false-positive results.
The literature reports false-positive rates between 3% and 8%. This
has caused a number of critics to decline to recommend UNHS until
the false-positive rate can be decreased and/or there is further
knowledge of the emotional effect this false-positive labeling has
on families. A number of studies from other newborn-screening tests
have shown that false-positive results can engender lasting anxiety
and adversely affect the parent-child relationship. In addition,
deUzcategiu and Yoshinga-Itano surveyed mothers immediately after
their children had failed the newborn hearing screen and found that
20% to 50% of mothers reported feelings, such as anger, confusion,
depression, frustration, shock, and sadness. However, it is still
unknown how persistent or detrimental these feelings are.*

This article ultimately concludes that with a reduction in the false
positive rate, that the benefits of UNHS outweigh the costs.

I'm trying to develop a good [set of web pages on diagnostic
testing](../category/DiagnosticTesting.html), but there is a lot of work
that I need to do. I also offer a couple of training classes that
discuss diagnostic tests:

- [Stats \#21: What do all these numbers mean? Sensitivity and
specificity](../training/hand21.asp)
- [Stats \#24: What do all these numbers mean? Likelihood
Ratios](../training/hand24.asp)
