**[StATS]:** **More on the retroactive prayer study
(June 10, 2005)**

I discuss an interesting study on the effects of prayer ([Leibovici
2001](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&db=pubmed&list_uids=11751349&dopt=Abstract))
published in BMJ, where the researcher prayed over a set of charts that
represented outcomes occurring four to ten years earlier. When these
results were compared to a control group of charts that were unprayed
for, there was a statistically significant difference between the two
groups.

This study flies in the face of what we know about causation (causes
always precede effects), and another article in BMJ ([Olshansky
2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=14684651&dopt=Abstract))
tries to develop a plausible mechanism for retrospective causation.

It\'s an interesting study that I discuss in a counterpoint to
biological plausibility in my book on Statistical Evidence. A couple of
recently published articles in the same journal also comment on this
study, but I cannot access these articles easily because BMJ now limits
access to some of their content for 12 months. When the 12 month window
has expired, I may comment on these articles further.
