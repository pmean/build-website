**[StATS]:** **The fate of retracted articles
(October 14, 2005)**

A member of the Evidence Based Health email discussion group noted an
interesting discussion about a recently retracted Cochrane review:

- **"Is CybermedicineKilling You?"\--The story of a Cochrane
disaster.** Eysenbach G, Kummervold PE. J Med Internet Res 2005:
7(2); e21.
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=15998612&dopt=Abstract)
[\[Full text\]](http://www.jmir.org/2005/2/e21)

It turns out that most journals do not have a clear written policy on
publishing retractions.

- **Retraction policies of high-impact biomedical journals.**
Atlas MC. J Med Libr Assoc 2004: 92(2); 242-50.
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=15098054&dopt=Abstract)

This article also cited research done in 1990 that showed that 82
fully retracted articles were nevertheless cited a total of 733
additional times after the article was retracted. The number of
invalid citations of retracted research was not concentrated in the
lower quality journals either. A control group of research papers
indicated retracted articles were indeed cited less often than
unretracted articles, but only by 35%.

- **The continued use of retracted, invalid scientific literature.**
Pfeifer MP, Snodgrass GL. Jama 1990: 263(10); 1420-3.

I will add some more details about this when I get the chance.
