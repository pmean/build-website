**[StATS]: Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic
Curve (January 21, 2005)**

In the past week, I have had two inquiries about how to perform a
meta-analysis of studies of a diagnostic test. An intriguing idea that I
discovered in researching this is the use of the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve to summarize the results of the studies. Each
study will have its own sensitivity and specificity, and plotting the
sensitivity/specificity pairs on the coordinates of an ROC plot, along
with some reference lines, will help you to evaluate the degree of
heterogeneity of the studies, among other things. An example of this
type of plot appears on the web at

and there are a couple of references that discuss this approach.

-   **Systematic reviews in health care: Systematic reviews of
    evaluations of diagnostic and screening tests.** Deeks JJ. British
    Medical Journal 2001: 323(7305); 157-62.

diagnostic tests are:
