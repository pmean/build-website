**[StATS]:** **Very low values from Cronbach\'s
Alpha (July 19, 2005)**.

Someone came to me with an analysis of a scale of 16 items, where the
Cronbach\'s alpha computed for that scale was only 0.14. The first thing
you should look for in this situation is whether some of the items on
the scale are reverse scaled. Sure enough, for 6 of the items, a small
value represented a positive outcome and for the remaining 10 items, a
large value represented a positive outcome. When the data was recoded so
that a large value represented a positive outcome on all 16 items,
Cronbach\'s alpha increased to 0.74.
