Roy Poses, a regular contributor to the email discussion group
Evidence Based Health wrote a provocative email pointing out the
manipulation of research, ghost-writing, and suppression of research
that is being done to support the marketing of unsafe and/or
ineffective drugs. Some of the web links that Dr. Poses included are
quite interesting.

He then goes on to wonder if this dishonesty invalidates the evidence
based medicine process.

*Physicians may no longer trust the EBM process to find an
approximation of the truth in the face of purposeful manipulation of
the evidence by vested interests*

There's no easy answer to this. One positive thing is that one of the
most powerful tools in the arsenal of EBM, the systematic review, is
the tool that has been used to uncover much of the dishonesty in
research. So you could argue that we would be a lot worse off if we
didn't have EBM, because we wouldn't even know we were being
deceived.

Another thing to remember is that a lot of research being done has no
vested commercial interests. The big drug trials get all the
attention, but there is a lot more to the practice of medicine than
just prescribing drugs. I'm not a doctor, but I suspect that most of
the things that you do to help your patients get better don't involve
a pill. Do we disregard all of the non-pharmaceutical research just
because the research on drugs is possibly tainted?

And you also might want to read a counterpoint to all the criticisms
about pharmaceutical statistics that was written by Stephen Senn.

We have to be careful not to throw out the baby with the bathwater. A
lot of good work is done by people with a commercial interest in the
outcome. You just have to make sure that the appropriate safeguards
are in place. Research done by people with a commercial interest in
the outcome is like observational research. Some of it is done badly
and some of it is done quite well. The trick is to recognize which is
which.

In spite of all this, I do share some of the pessimism of Dr. Poses.
There's a lot of funny stuff going on behind the scenes and it is
almost impossible for us outsiders to uncover the truth.
