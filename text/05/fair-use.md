I get many requests to link to my web pages, and I always grant these
requests. Other people ask if they can use portions of my material on
their web pages or in their publications. If these people don't
charge others for this material, I usually agree, but I like to know a
few more details. If there is money involved, I tend to be more
cautious.

Of course, the copyright law allows you some rights to reproduce
materials on my web site (or any other copyrighted source) under the
"Fair Use" provisions of the copyright law.

Fair use is a rather gray area in copyright law, but typically looks
at the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted
work, the amount of material in relation to the work as a whole, and
the effect of the use on potential market value for the original
author.

If your use of my materials qualifies under the "Fair Use"
provisions, you don't need to seek my permission. It would be nice,
of course, if you let me know that you are using my material, as it
gives me something to show my boss as evidence of the value of the web
pages that I have written.
