Today I gave a talk on meta-analysis. I started with a general
[overview of meta-analysis](../model/metaanalysis.asp), and then
discussed some of the particular problems associated with a
[meta-analysis of a diagnostic test](../model/diagnostic.asp).

The discussion was quite lively, and wide-ranging. At one point, we
were talking about how to respond to a bad referee report for a paper
you are trying to get published. I mentioned how it is difficult to
argue with a referee although a few times I have had to resort to a
"my referee is an idiot" defense. Most of the time, I just try to go
along with what the referee says unless their suggestions do violence
to the statistics.

One of the other people mentioned that he would often cite a paper by
Moye published in 2001 in Circulation when arguing with a referee
about changing the analysis. It turns out that I had this paper in my
files already. The full citation is

- **Random research.** Moye LA. Circulation 2001: 103(25); 3150-3.
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11425783&dopt=Abstract)
[\[Abstract\]](http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/103/25/3150)
[\[Full
text\]](http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/103/25/3150)
[\[PDF\]](http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/103/25/3150.pdf)

and it discusses the problems with unwarranted changes in a research
protocol. I may have to try this the next time I have to respond to a
referee report. Actually, it is usually not my paper. Most of the
time, someone comes to me with a referee report on a paper I have
never seen before and asks for help in responding to the referee's
critical comments.

Dr. Moye has also written an excellent book:

- **Statistical Reasoning in Medicine. The Intuitive P-Value
Primer.** Moye LA (2000) New York: Springer-Verlag. ISBN:
0387989331. [\[BookFinder4U
link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0387989331.html)

which has a lot of lively and entertaining examples in its pages.

We had a lot of interesting comments during my talk, and I agreed to
give another talk on meta-analysis at a later date. I would just give
a non-technical overview based on my chapter:

- [(Do not bookmark) Statistical Evidence. Chapter 5.
Meta-analysis.](../journal/book07.htm)

in the [book I am trying to get published](../evidence.asp). The link
to this chapter will disappear when the book is published, so please
do not bookmark it.
