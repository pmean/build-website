**[StATS]:** **Publicon software (March 14, 2005)**

[Wolfram Research](http://www.wolfram.com/), makers of the famous
software for symbolic mathematical calculations,
[Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/), have
released a new product for technical publications,
[Publicon](http://www.wolfram.com/products/publicon/index.html).
According to their website,

> *Publicon provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for creating
> publication-quality technical documents that integrate text,
> searchable typeset equations, graphics, hyperlinks, endnotes, and
> references. Built-in palettes, templates, and style sheets simplify
> the creation of documents that conform to established formats but also
> allow for complete customization.*

This software will produce nice looking output in
[html](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html),
[xml](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), or
[LaTex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). [BioMed
Central](http://www.biomedcentral.com) has announced that it will
[support the use of
Publicon](http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/ifora/publicon) because it
will offer faster and more accurate translation to their XML format.
BioMed Central will also will offer authors a discount on the article
processing charge if they use this product.
