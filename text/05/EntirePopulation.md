**[StATS]:** **Sampling the entire population
(February 3, 2005)**

A commonly occurring question is what to do when you have a small
population that you are sampling and your sample effectively constitutes
all or almost all of the population. For example, I got the following
email today.

> *I conduct pro bono surveys for schools in my area. For my real job we

There are two schools of thought on this. The first school argues that
confidence intervals and p-values are irrelevant. You have the entire
population, so you have zero sampling error.

The second school argues that you often want to extrapolate to a
conceptual larger population, such as all teachers in the present and
future years.

Except in some very narrowly drawn circumstances, I tend to follow the
second school. For such a conceptual population, confidence intervals
and p-values are still meaningful.

An earlier weblog entry

-   [Â Enumerative and Analytic Studies (February
    5, 2004)](http://www.childrensmercy.org/stats/weblog2004/enumerative.asp)

discusses this concept in further detail.
