**[StATS]:** **Counterpoint on Google Scholar (July
19, 2005)**

A recently published article:

-   **Google Scholar: A source for clinicians?** Henderson J. Cmaj 2005:
    172(12); 1549-50.
    [\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=15939908&dopt=Abstract)
    [\[Full text\]](http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/172/12/1549)
    [\[PDF\]](http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/172/12/1549.pdf)

casts some doubt on the utility of Google Scholar as a resource for
searching for medical information and describes some competing
resources, such as:

-   TRIP [www.tripdatabase.org](http://www.tripdatabase.org)
-   Scirus [www.scirus.com](http://www.scirus.com)
-   OAIster <http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu>Â 

A [Rapid Response letter](http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/eletters/172/12/1549)
added some additional comments and noted a valuable paper on optimizing
your Medline search:

-   **Optimal search strategies for retrieving scientifically strong
    studies of treatment from Medline: analytical survey.** Haynes RB,
    McKibbon KA, Wilczynski NL, Walter SD, Werre SR. Bmj 2005:
    330(7501); 1179.
