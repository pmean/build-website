> ***A Visit to the ER from St. Nick***
>
> *Twas the night before surgery, and all \'cross the floor\
> The patients were buzzing \'bout the guy in Room Four.\
> His chart was hung on his door with great care\
> To make sure his name was not shown anywhere.*
>
> *The patients were nestled all snug in their beds\
> While telemetry monitors beeped overhead.\
> And I in my gown, with its crack in the back,\
> Had just settled down for my clear liquid snack.*
>
> *When down the hall there arose such a clatter,\
> I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.\
> I pulled off my leads and flew out the door,\
> With my IV pole dragging behind on the floor.*
>
> *Away to Room Four I hurriedly dashed\
> Unaware of my gown and the nurses I flashed.\
> As I slid to a halt and leaned to peek in\
> I heard the nurse say, \"Sir, you mustn\'t go in!\"*
>
> *And what did I see when I looked in Bed A\
> But ole Mr. Claus; on his belly he lay.\
> Covered in gauze and stuck high in the air\
> Oh what a sight, \'twas St. Nick\'s derriere!*
>
> *He was yelling at Doris, the nurse at his side\
> To be tied to this bed, he just could not abide.\
> He moaned and he bellowed about his ill luck\
> But there was just nothing for it; the old man was stuck.*
>
> *\"What happened to Santa?\" to Doris I said,\
> \"Why\'s he on his belly in this hospital bed?\"\
> With a grin she whispered, \"He did something stupid.\
> He injured his butt when he backed into Cupid.\"*
>
> *But the old man\'s ears were sharp as tack.\
> He heard what she said there behind his back.\
> \"You had no right to speak, and that is a fact!\
> Don\'t you know about HIPAA, the privacy act?\"*
>
> *\"You\'re out of compliance, Doris, my dear.\
> You had no right to tell him \'bout my injured rear!\
> I\'ll sue you for breach, and this hospital, too!\
> You won\'t have a job when I\'m through with you!\"*
>
> *\"When I check my list and then check it twice,\
> You\'ll be in the column labeled \'Not Nice.\'\
> The HIPAA patrol will likewise drop by\
> To find out why you, Doris, did not comply!\"*
>
> *\"They\'ll want to know why you opened your yap,\
> A big, hefty fine on your butt they will slap.\
> And from me every Christmas you will now see\
> Nothing but switches and coal \'neath your tree.\"*
>
> *Merry Christmas and HIPAA New Year!*
