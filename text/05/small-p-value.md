**[StATS]:** **A small p-value does not mean a large
difference (February 8, 2005)**

Someone asked me if the p-value for a t-test indicates the size of the
difference between two groups. It turns out that the p-value is related
both to the size of the difference and the sample size. In general, a
very small p-value might indicate a large difference, a large sample
size, or both. It would be better to use a confidence interval rather
than a p-value because you won't have any ambiguity with the confidence
interval.
