This page is outdated, but I am keeping it because I am an electronic
pack rat.

Here are all the details on how you can contact me: address, phone, fax,
and email. I prefer email.

**How to get in touch with me**

Steve Simon
Office of Medical Research
Children's Mercy Hospital
2401 Gillham Road
Kansas City, MO 64108

Telephone: (816) 234-3963
FAX: (816) 855-1703
e-mail: ssimon (at) cmh (dot) edu

If you would like to meet with me, send me an email (see above) or
call me (see above). You can also talk to Judy Champion (816-983-6784)
or Vicki Parker (816-234-3961) who both have the ability to check my
schedule and make appointments.

If you use Meditech to send me emails, please be sure to sign your
message. I have a gateway program that automatically routes Meditech
email to my Microsoft account, but it makes it impossible to use the
REPLY key, and the return address is very cryptic. Here's an an
example of one of those emails:

*From: MD-LCO@meditech.cmh.edu [mailto:MD-LCO@meditech.cmh.edu]
Sent: Wednesday, June 30, 2004 4:28 PM
To: Simon, Steve, PhD
Subject:

Steve, is there a software program that plots ROC curves?
Thanks, LCO*

At this point I have to play a guessing game, because MD-LCO is not
the most descriptive email address. Also, please be sure to include a
subject line in your email. I get a lot of Spam, which I delete
without reading. If your email does not have a descriptive subject
line, I might mistakenly delete your message.

**Making appointments**

If I get a chance to set you up with the appropriate permissions, you
will have the ability to review my calendar (but not make
appointments).

  Open Microsoft Outlook and select File | Open |Other User's Folder
from the menu.

![consul2.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/05/contact02.png)

Type my name and switch from Inbox to Calendar. I'm not the only
Simon at Children's Mercy Hospital.

Pick me out of the list of other Simons and click on OK. It this
works, you'll be able to see my schedule.

The next time around it is even easier,

![consul4.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/05/contact05.png)

because you'll see my name on the list of choices.

**Accessing shared folders**

If I have set up a shared folder for you, you can access it through
the MY COMPUTER icon. Double click on this icon and select TOOLS |
MAP NETWORK DRIVE from the menu.

![consul6.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/05/contact06.png)

The MAP NETWORK DRIVE dialog box appears

![consul7.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/05/contact07.png)

It will show you the first unused letter in your list of computer
drives and network connections. I suggest that you change this to an
unused letter (S is probably a good choice) but you should make sure
that whatever letter you choose isn't currently being used. If you
select U, for example, you will see the following

![consul8.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/05/contact08.png)

which indicates that U is already reserved for \\\\CMH\\DATA\\USERS.
Once you have selected an unused letter, type the name of the network
folder in the FOLDER field. It will be a name that is quite long, such
as

\\\\cmhfs1\\Groups\\Statistics Research Data\\Special Project Name

where "Special Project Name" is replaced by the name I give you.

![consul9.gif not found.](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/05/contact09.png)

Make sure that the check box for RECONNECT AT LOGON is selected and
then click on the FINISH button.

You can also embed the folder name as a link in a file, but you have
to convert any blanks to a special code (%20) first. So if you create
a link to

[\\\\cmhfs1\\Groups\\Statistics%20Research%20Data\\Special%20Project%20Name](file://cmhfs1/Groups/Statistics%20Research%20Data/Special%20Project%20Name)

then clicking on that link will open that folder.

For any of these methods to work, you have to be connected to the CMH
network, of course, and you have to have permission from me to access
the particular folder.
