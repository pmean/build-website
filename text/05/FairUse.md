> I get many requests to link to my web pages, and I always grant these
> requests. Other people ask if they can use portions of my material on
> their web pages or in their publications. If these people don\'t
> charge others for this material, I usually agree, but I like to know a
> few more details. If there is money involved, I tend to be more
> cautious.
>
> Of course, the copyright law allows you some rights to reproduce
> materials on my web site (or any other copyrighted source) under the
> \"Fair Use\" provisions of the copyright law.
>
> Fair use is a rather gray area in copyright law, but typically looks
> at the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted
> work, the amount of material in relation to the work as a whole, and
> the effect of the use on potential market value for the original
> author.

> If your use of my materials qualifies under the \"Fair Use\"
> provisions, you don\'t need to seek my permission. It would be nice,
> of course, if you let me know that you are using my material, as it
> gives me something to show my boss as evidence of the value of the web
> pages that I have written.
