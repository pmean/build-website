**[StATS]: Developing good practice guidelines
(February 18, 2005)** [](../category/TeachingResources.html)

A physician here, Lloyd Olson, who has been aggressively promoting
Evidence Based Medicine suggested the following interesting article on
practice guidelines.<U+FFFD>

- **Are guidelines following guidelines? The methodological quality of
clinical practice guidelines in the peer-reviewed medical
literature.** Shaneyfelt TM, Mayo-Smith MF, Rothwangl J. Jama 1999:
281(20); 1900-5.
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10349893&dopt=Abstract)

According to the article, practice guidelines are

*"systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and
patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical
circumstances."*

The article evaluated 279 guidelines published between 1985 and 1997 on
a list of 25 items:

1.  *Purpose of the guideline is specified.*
2.  *Rationale and importance of the guideline are explained.*
3.  *The participants in the guideline development process and their
area of expertise are specified.*
4.  *Targeted health problem or technology is clearly defined.*
5.  *Targeted patient population is specified.*
6.  *Intended audience or users of the guideline are specified.*
7.  *The principal preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic options
available to clinicians and patients are specified.*
8.  *The health outcomes are specified.*
9.  *The method by which the guideline underwent external review is
specified.*
10. *An expiration date or date of scheduled review is specified.*
11. *Method of identifying scientific evidence is specified.*
12. *Time period from which evidence is reviewed is specified.*
13. *The evidence used is identified by citation and referenced.*
14. *Method of data extraction is specified.*
15. *Method fro grading or classifying the scientific evidence is
specified.*
16. *Formal methods of combining evidence or expert opinion are used and
described.*
17. *Benefits and harms of specific health practices are specified.*
18. *Benefits and harms are quantified.*
19. *The effect on health care costs from specific health practices is
specified.*
20. *Costs are quantified.*
21. *The role of value judgments used by the guideline developers in
making recommendation is discussed.*
22. *The role of patient preferences is discussed.*
23. *Recommendations are specific and apply to the stated goals of the
guideline.*
24. *Recomendations are graded according to the strength of the
evidence.*
25. *Flexibility in the recommendations is specified.*

Although there are some improvement over time, the overall degree of
compliance with these items was still only about half in 1997.
