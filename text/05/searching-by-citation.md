**[StATS]:** **Searching the Internet (April 26,
2005)**

A response to a question on the [stat-l discussion
group](http://lists.mcgill.ca/archives/stat-l.html) provided a clever
way of searching the Internet. Someone asked about finding references
about how to analyze ordinal data. There were several good responses,
but there was one that I liked best.

This person suggested doing a citation search using Google Scholar. The
way you do this is to find a key reference book. In this case, he
suggested the book by Alan Agresti, Analysis of ordinal categorical data
(ISBN 0471890553). Find this book on Google Scholar by searching on
Agresti ordinal. Here's the results of that search.

Each result in Google Scholar also includes a cited by link. The Agresti
book was cited by 228 other sources. Click on that link to find a wealth
of resources related to ordinal data.

You can also browse
for pages similar to this one at [Category: Information
searching](../category/InformationSearching.html).
