This test was first describe in

- J. A. Hartigan, P. M. Hartigan. The Dip Test of Unimodality. The Annals of Statistics. 1985;13(1):70-84. 

- P. M. Hartigan. Algorithm AS 217: Computation of the Dip Statistic to Test for Unimodality. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series C (Applied Statistics). 1985;34(3):320-325. Article is [behind a paywall][har1].

There is software to run the dip test in [R][mae1], [Stata][cox1], and [FORTRAN][app1].
