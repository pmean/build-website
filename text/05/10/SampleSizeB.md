**[StATS]:** **Sample size for a binomial confidence
interval (October 3, 2005)**

Someone asked me for some help with a homework question. I hesitate to
offer too much advice in these situations because I don\'t want to
disrupt the teacher\'s efforts to get the students to think on their
own.

This sure sounds like they want a sample size that will produce a 95%
confidence interval that has a width of plus or minus 5%. The confidence
interval is based on a single binomial distribution, I suspect, rather
than a difference in two binomial proportions. There\'s a bit of
ambiguity in the wording, so it always helps to get a bit of
clarification.

I have a spreadsheet that does confidence interval calculations for a
single binomial proportion and you can play some \"what-if\" games to
arrive at an appropriate sample size. But there are also formulas that
you can use. Here are two web sites that provide simple and easy to
follow guidance.
