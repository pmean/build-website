**[StATS]:** **Two nice R libraries (October 14,
2005)**.

I found a couple of nice libraries in R available from [CRAN
(Comprehensive R Achive Network)](http://cran.r-project.org/). The
first, vcd, was recommended by a regular contributor to the epidemio-l
list. This library provides visualization techniques with special
emphasis on categorical data. There is a nice function to draw a series
of odds ratios and confidence intervals, for example, and very simple
code to produce a mosaic plot. A more thorough description of vcd is
available at

-   [cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/vcd.html](http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/vcd.html)

According to the description, the functions in vcd were inspired by the
book

-   **Visualizing Categorical Data**. Michael Friendly, Cary, NC: SAS
    Publishing. [\[BookFinder4U
    link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/1580256600.html)

which I do not have in my library, but which sounds like a very
interesting book.

I found the second library, epitools, when I went searching on the web
for resources to calculate an exact confidence interval for a Poisson
rate. In addition to the exact Poisson intervals, the package can
perform age standardization, draw epidemic curves, and has a variety of
useful utility functions and interesting data sets. The description of
epitools is available at

-   [cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/epitools.html](http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/epitools.html)

and the authors maintain a site for this library and other free software
at
