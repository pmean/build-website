Someone asked me whether it was okay to define a correlation coefficient
as a descriptive statistic. It depends on whether the correlation is
being used to describe a population or if it is intended to test a
particular hypothesis. I also warned that these types of labels
(inferential, descriptive) aren\'t really needed most of the time.

After I responded to her, I realized that I didn\'t have a decent
definition of inferential or descriptive statistics, so I add them and
found a few examples on the BioMed Central website.
