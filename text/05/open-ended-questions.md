No one seems to talk about how to handle those pesky open-ended
questions you see on a survey. I usually hold my breath and hope that
the researcher doesn't think to mention it. Alicia O'Cathain and Kate
Thomas address this important issue in a recently published article,

- **"Any other comments?" Open questions on questionnaires - a bane
or a bonus to research?** O'Cathain A, Thomas KJ. BMC Med Res
Methodol 2004: 4(1); 25.

and they gently scold us for ignoring an important source of
information.

*Researchers may use general open questions without giving much
thought to why they are doing so, simply including the question
because it is usual practice. Or they may be driven by a desire to
offer respondents an opportunity to voice their opinion. Closed
questions represent the researchers' agenda, even if they have been
developed through listening to people's views in focus groups and
depth interviews. The use of 'any other comments' may redress the
power balance between researchers and research participants.
Respondents may take this opportunity to ask for clarification or
information about a health issue or health service, or voice concern
about the research. If researchers include a general open question for
this reason then they will need to consider how best to respond to
individuals about such queries and concerns.*

What should you do with this data?

*General open questions may produce little more than the closed
questions on the questionnaire and rather than considering it
unethical to analyse these responses, a more appropriate strategy
might be preliminary analysis involving reading the responses so that
the researcher can consider the contribution they make to the study
overall. If the comments merely corroborate or slightly elaborate upon
the answers to closed questions, then formal analysis may not be
worthwhile \[23\]. It may be good practice to report within
publications that the responses to the general open question did not
provide additional information to the closed questions. It is where
they offer insights or issues not available in the closed questions
that formal analysis could be considered good practice, even if the
role of this analysis is to identify hypotheses or questions for
further study. Formal analysis may be prompted by either the strength
of numbers making particular comments, or the strength of feeling
within a small number of the comments.*

A first step is to see if those who responded to the open ended question
differ in their demographics from those who did not. O'Cathain and Kate
Thomas cite an example of a nursing survey where the proportion of open
ended respondents increased among those who were dissatisfied with their
jobs.

The authors also suggest content analysis.

*Content analysis may be undertaken where the researcher takes the
following steps:*

*1. Reads a sub-set of the comments.*

*2. Devises a coding frame to describe the thematic content of the
comments.*

*3. Assigns the codes to all the comments. The coding frame can be
applied using software designed for this purpose or manually. Two
coders may be needed to test the reliability of assigning codes.*

*4. The codes can be entered into a statistical package alongside the
data from the closed questions and treated as variables in a
quantitative analysis.*

This is not exactly a formal qualitative analysis, but it is similar
enough that you may want to consult with an expert in this area.

You can and should use quote of particular comments that give your
reader an idea of what the general tenor of the comments was like. Be
sure, though, that you don't include any information that might violate
patient confidentiality.
