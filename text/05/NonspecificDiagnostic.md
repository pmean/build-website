**[StATS]:** **A nonspecific diagnostic test
(October 13, 2005)**

> Someone posted a note on the IRBFORUM complaining that the IRB was
> preventing him/her from volunteering for a test. This company has a
> very promising \"non-intrusive Universal Early Cancer Detection test\"
> but the company could not take any volunteers before getting IRB
> approval. There were a lot of good comments, but one thing that caught
> my eye in a later email was the following claim:
>
> > *Besides, the test itself is non-intrusive: they will take 2 micro
> > liter samples of blood and within 3 hours we get our results on any
> > type of 1\_week\_or\_older cancer.*
>
> This claims illustrates a very important point: research claims which
> lack specificity also lack credibility. A treatment that claims to
> cure everything probably cures nothing.
>
> Specificity was one of the nine conditions that Sir Bradford Hill
> developed in 1965 to argue when the evidence was persuasive enough to
> establish a causal link. There are a few limited exceptions (aspirin
> is helpful for a wide range of conditions) but the principle has stood
> the test of time.
>
> Let\'s look again at the original claim. This diagnostic test can
> detect ANY type of cancer. That\'s certainly possible, but extremely
> unlikely. The ways that breast cancer, melanoma, leukemia, prostate
> cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer, etc. progress are quite
> different, and it extremely unlikely that a diagnostic test could find
> the single biomarker that was common to all these types of cancer,
> because that biomarker probably does not exist.
>
> The claim is even more non-specific than that, though. The test,
> apparently, can detect cancer that is only ONE WEEK OLD. That is a
> rather amazing claim if you think about it. Most one week old tumors
> are microscopic, I suspect, but this test is claimed to be sensitive
> enough to detect even these tumors.
>
> There are other technical issues worth discussing, such as the
> possibility that this test will confuse benign and malignant tumors,
> but the bottom line is that a diagnostic test that claims to detect
> any type of tumor, even one week old tumors, is probably worthless.
>
> Now, I have no problem with letting these scientists test their
> product (carefully and ethically, of course). If they are right and I
> am wrong, then they can quote my email and laugh at me when they claim
> their Nobel Prize. But based on past experience, claims that are
> overly broad usually represent either delusional thinking or the use
> of highly biased research samples.
