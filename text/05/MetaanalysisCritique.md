A contributor to the Evidence-Based Medicine list offered a possible
criticism of meta-analysis. The criticism was along the lines of (I am
paraphrasing and summarizing):

> Suppose we have two randomized trials coming up with exactly the
> opposite conclusion. Assume that bias and confounding are not an issue
> here. Then one study may be wrong. When meta-analysis takes an average
> of a correct value and an incorrect value, you will get a meaningless
> result.
>
> Now assume that the two results differ because they were studying two
> very different patient populations. An average here is also
> misleading, unless you weight by the proportion of the true overall
> population that these two patient populations come from.

Here\'s the gist of my response.

The error that this person describes is the error not of meta-analysis,
but rather the error of a meta-analysis that ignores heterogeneity. Is
heterogeneity present in all meta-analyses and does it result in flawed
conclusions in all meta-analyses? Arguing that it is possible to make an
error using meta-analysis naively does not imply that all meta-analyses
are flawed, especially considering that the folks performing
meta-analysis have been aware of the problems caused by heterogeneity
and have several proposed solutions to this problem.

Furthermore, if you have two contradictory RCTs, it may be that the
patients that you see are dissimilar from either of the two trials.
Maybe there is a third reality that applies to your particular patients.
So you can\'t trust the first trial, you can\'t trust the second trial,
nor can you trust the meta-analysis.

So what can we conclude here? Meta-analysis can be misleading? That\'s
hardly surprising. All research can be misleading if it is conducted
poorly. And all research can be misleading if you fail to consider how
the patients you see are different from the patients being studied by
the researchers themselves.

All of our research tools are flawed. The trick comes from understanding
when the flaws are trivial and when they are fatal.

Furthermore, this looks like a \"straw man\" argument to me. You
describe an application of meta-analysis that is so simplistic that it
does not represent anything even remotely close to how meta-analysis is
practiced today. You cite a \"flaw\" of meta-analysis that has been well
known for at least a decade or two and for which there has been
substantial research efforts.

If meta-analysis is indeed a flawed process, cite a particular
meta-analysis that has lead to an incorrect conclusion and then explain
to us why it has failed. That would lead to a far more productive debate
than some hypothetical speculation.

Finally, to say a research method is flawed is troublesome when you
don\'t offer a serious alternative. There are some folks who argue that
a large scale randomized trial is the definitive approach and that
meta-analysis is only second best. There are others who argue that a
carefully done meta-analysis is superior. Ironically, heterogeneity is
one of meta-analyses strengths, as its proponents have noted. If a
research finding is replicated across a variety of patient populations
under a variety of research designs, the meta-analysis is the best way
to show robustness of the finding. In other words, a uniform finding
across heterogenous studies is far more persuasive than a single finding
in a single population.

But rather than offer a serious alternative to meta-analysis, the author
of these comments seems to be saying that almost all research is flawed.
That\'s a very dangerous thing to be saying, because disregarding good
research findings, no matter what the research design that generated
them, can be dangerous to our health.

Rather than asking if meta-analysis is flawed, I would ask \"Are we
better off or worse off having the tool called meta-analysis in our
research arsenal.\" And my answer is yes, we\'re much better off as long
as we keep these tools out of the hands of amateurs.
