I am running for an elected office, the Vice-Chair of District 4, Region
2, of the Council of Chapters for the American Statistical Association.
I could make some jokes about this, but in all honesty, it is flattering
to be nominated for this position. District 4 incorporates the following
ASA chapters:

- Ann Arbor,
- Central Illinois,
- Central Indiana,
- Chicago,
- Detroit,
- Iowa,
- Kansas/Western Missouri,
- Kentucky,
- Mid-Michigan,
- Mid-Missouri,
- Milwaukee,
- NE Illinois,
- Nebraska,
- Oklahoma,
- Red River Valley,
- St. Louis,
- SW Michigan,
- Twin Cities

I had to prepare a brief biography of myself, so I thought I'd present
the first draft here in case anyone was curious what I have been doing
with my career in Statistics. I'm also doing this because the web page
where I submitted this information crashed on me and I wanted to place
my biography in an accessible location for the appropriate people at the
American Statistical Association.

**Present Position**

Mercy Hospital, May 1996 to present, with a joint appointment as

**Fields of Major Statistical Activities**

My major research focus is the application of Evidence Based Medicine.
In particular, I am very interested in understanding when the
statistical evidence in a medical journal article becomes persuasive
enough to convince a practicing clinician to change their medical
practice. I have a series of web pages devoted to this topic that have
been widely cited and translated into Spanish. I am working on a book
based on these web pages (working title: Statistical Evidence in
Medical Trials) that will be published by Oxford University Press in
2006.

I also have a strong interest in Quality Control, especially in the
research laboratory. I have helped organize several day long workshops
at national meetings for the American Society of Andrology and
presented lectures on starting a quality control program in a
laboratory.

I am co-author on 56 additional research articles, including a series
of four invited editorials at the Journal of Andrology.
