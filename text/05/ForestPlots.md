Many meta-analyses use a graph known as a forest plot. I was always
confused by the funny squares in a forest plot, so I looked for a
description. An example of a forest plot appears in

- **Acetylcysteine for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy
after intravascular angiography: a systematic review and
meta-analysis.** Bagshaw SM, Ghali WA. BMC Med 2004: 2(1); 38.

and because this is an open-access article, I can reproduce the graph
here.

  Here is what the User's Guide for RevMan (software created by the
Cochrane Collaboration) says about forest plots:

*The graph is a forest plot where the confidence interval (CI) for
each study is represented by a horizontal line and the point estimate
is represented by a square. The size of the square corresponds to the
weight of the study in the meta-analysis. The confidence interval for
totals are represented by a diamond shape. The scale used on the graph
depends on the statistical method. Dichotomous data (except for risk
differences) are displayed on a logarithmic scale. Continuous data and
risk differences are displayed on a linear scale. Generic inverse
variance data are displayed on either a logarithmic scale or a linear
scale depending on the settings in RevMan.* --
