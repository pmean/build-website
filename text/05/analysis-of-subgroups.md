> *Analysis of subgroup results in a clinical trial is surprisingly
> unreliable, even in a large trial. This is the result of a combination
> of reduced statistical power, increased variance and the play of
> chance. Reliance on such analyses is likely to be more erroneous, and
> hence harmful, than application of the overall proportional (or
> relative) result in the whole trial to the estimate of absolute risk
> in that subgroup. Plausible explanations can usually be found for
> effects that are, in reality, simply due to the play of chance. When
> clinicians believe such subgroup analyses, there is a real danger of
> harm to the individual patient.* Peter Sleight, **Debate: Subgroup
> analyses in clinical trials: fun to look at - but don't believe
> them!** Curr Control Trials Cardiovasc Med 2000: 1(1); 25-27.
