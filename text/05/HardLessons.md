It\'s been a busy month, as noted below, and in a rush to complete all
my projects, I ended up doing some things that may have caused a few
problems (nothing permanent, of course, but they did up delaying further
some projects that were already behind schedule). I alluded to a bit of
this in my weblog entry

-   Non-destructive data editing (November 2, 2005)

but I have a few more lessons worth mentioning.

1.  It is very difficult to perform a good data analysis by email and
    telephone. A good data analysis requires a lot of dialog that can
    only be done in a face-to-face setting. Often I will produce a graph
    or table and have to ask a simple question like \"Is this what you
    expected?\" to make sure that I am on the right track. Sometimes I
    will need more information about a variable but will only realize
    this halfway through the analysis. I hate to ask busy people to sit
    with me as I work through a data analysis, but I am starting to
    realize that without this interaction, I cannot produce results
    quickly and accurately.
2.  Excel is a very fragile medium for the storage of data. On one
    project, I had to sort the data in order to identify dates of events
    that were within 30 days of other events in the data set. In Excel,
    it is easy to end up sorting just some of the columns or just some
    of the rows, leading to the production of a data set that has
    grossly incorrect results.
3.  You can\'t just jump in and run the final statistical model for a
    project without first laying a firm foundation of preliminary
    charts, tables, and graphs. This is a lesson I harp on in many of my
    classes, but one that I have ignored myself at my own peril. In
    particular, I had a data analysis that involved survival times with
    time varying covariates and with multiple events per patient. It\'s
    not that difficult an analysis to run, but it does require some
    care. But instead of starting with some simple analysis (estimating
    survival probabilities before incorporating time varying covariates,
    or estimating the time to the first event), I ended up jumping right
    straight in to the final statistical model. In the process, I ended
    up making some serious errors. These errors were fixable, but the
    time I spent fixing them was far more than the time I would have
    spent laying the proper foundation.
