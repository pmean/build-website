**[StATS]:** **PubMed tags (April 28, 2005)**

Searching in PubMed can be tricky. If you don't find what you want the
first time, it may help to specify exactly what part of the PubMed
record you want to search for.

For example, I was searching on Schiavo to see if there were any
interesting commentaries about this case in PubMed Central. But when I
searched simply on "Schiavo," PubMed gave me 10 articles where one of
the authors had a last name of Schiavo. I could search instead for
"Schiavo [ti]" which would limit my search to those articles where
the word "Schiavo" appeared in the title of the publication.

Other useful tags in PubMed are:

- [au] author name
- [la] language
- [ta] journal title
- [dp] date of publication

The [ta] tag is very useful when the name of the journal (e.g.,
Circulation) is also a commonly used medical term. You can also search
by the journal's ISSN number if you know it.

The [dp] tag uses the YYYY/MM/DD format and you can specify only the
year or only the year/month. You can also specify a range using a colon
between the two dates. Finally, you can search the last X days by
specifying "last X days [dp]" in your search. This also works for
the last X months and the last X years. The [tiab] tag allows you to
search for words in either the title or the abstract.

The "free full text [sb]" tag will retrieve only those articles with
free full text on the web. For example, searching on "L'Abbe plot"
yielded seven references, but when I searched on "free full text [sb]
L'Abbe plot" I got the two articles which had free full text on the
web. When you are looking for good teaching examples, it is wonderful to
search for publications that you can link to directly, knowing that
everyone who reads your pages will be able to view the full article if
they so desire.

You can also search for certain publication types such as Review,
Clinical Trial, or Editorial using the [pt] tag.

The [tw] tag searches for words in the title, abstract, and MeSH
terms.

MeSH, by the way, stands for "Medical Subject Headings" and is an
attempt by PubMed to create a hierarchy of medical terms to help make
searches more efficient. You can learn all about MeSH at
