The New York Times has a nice article about Dr. James Tanner, an expert
on childhood growth.

- **With His Bells and Curves, Human Growth Science Grew Up.** Hall
SS. The New York Times, March 1, 2005. Available in [html format][hall1].

This article contrasts the growth charts developed by Dr. Tanner with
[growth charts developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/).

*Dr. Tanner and his colleagues at the Institute for Child Health in
London revolutionized growth charts in the 1960's by taking into
account variations in a child's tempo of growth. Rather than
one-size-fits-all curves, the Tanner-derived charts have separate
curves, with a separate set of percentiles, for early-, average- and
late-maturing boys and girls. Thus they expand the range of normal
growth, using curves that are more forgiving of individual variation,
especially around the crucial time of puberty.*

*These subtle differences derive from the kind of data used to create
a growth chart. The American charts (and some modern European charts)
primarily rely on cross-sectional data: researchers take a large group
of children, separate them by age, measure them one time and then plot
the distribution of heights and weights for each age group.*

*In contrast, Dr. Tanner and others believe a more accurate (and
flexible) picture of a child's growth emerges from so-called
longitudinal studies, where the same children are repeatedly measured
over the course of many years of growth, so that individual variations
in tempo - those who mature early and those who mature late - can be
statistically incorporated into the charts. The data for such charts
are more logistically difficult and costly to collect. But some growth
experts believe such charts provide a more realistic picture of
variation in individual growth patterns.*

Even though the CDC approach may be simplistic, it is still relies on a
very sophisticated model that allows for changes over time in the spread
of the data and in the skewness of the data.
