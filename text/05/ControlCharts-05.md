**[StATS]: Control charts for monitoring mortality
rates (created 2005-02-11)**.

One of the trickiest problems in Medicine is trying to identify whether
an unusual trend in mortality rates is an indication of an incompetent
physician, or worse, a physician who is actively killing patients.

I have not read the following article, but it proposes the use of
control charts for monitoring mortality rates. From the abstract, it
looks like a promising approach.

-   **Monitoring surgical performance using risk-adjusted cumulative sum
    charts.** Steiner SH, Cook RJ, Farewell VT, Treasure T.
    Biostatistics 2000: 1(4); 441-52.

A recent BMJ article

-   BMJ 2005;330:329 (12 February), doi:10.1136/bmj.330.7487.329

discusses the use of this type of control chart in a particular hospital
that had a hospital standardized mortality ratio of 130, which was
\"*the highest of all main acute hospitals in England (30% above the
value for England as a whole, which is 100)*\". In response, the authors
used control charts to reduce this rate to 92.8, with the largest
reductions in circulatory diseases and respiratory diseases.
