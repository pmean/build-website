**[StATS]:** **Measuring agreement (April 19,
2005)**

Someone reviewing a paper asked me about all the \"weird statistics\"
being used in the paper, such as the Bland-Altman plot and Deming
regression.

The Bland-Altman plot is a fairly standard way to compare the agreement
between two measures of the clinical outcome.

-   **Statistical methods for assessing agreement between two methods of
    clinical measurement.** Bland JM, Altman DG. Lancet 1986: 1(8476);
    307-10.

Here\'s an example of a Bland-Altman plot

that compares functional residual capacity by two approaches:
rebreathing of sulphur hexafluoride and by computed tomography. The two
measures appear to be reasonably close to one another, and the degree of
agreement is about the same across the full range of the data. This
graph appears in

Deming regression is just the same thing as linear regression except
that an adjustment is made for measurement error in the independent
variable.

    confidence interval in method-comparison studies.** Martin RF. Clin
    Chem 2000: 46(1); 100-4.

As an example of Deming regression, two immunoassays for human glandular
kallikrein were compared using Deming regression. The slope was 0.79
(95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.92) and the intercept was 0.014 (95%
CI 0.004 to 0.025) with an R-squared value of 0.67. This line (the solid
line in the graph below) differs from the ideal line with slope=1 and
intercept=0 (the dotted line) and has a weak correlation, since one
assay can only account for 2/3 of the variation in the other assay.

The authors may have also used something called Lin\'s Concordance
Coefficient.

    of the Concordance Correlation Coefficient

An example of Lin\'s concordance coefficient appears in a study of joint
space narrowing and erosion scores in plain versus digitized x-rays. The
erosion concordance score is 0.89 and the graph below shows good
agreement between the regression line (solid) and the line of perfect
agreement (dashed).

![](../weblog/06images/weblog3.gif){width="300" height="244"}

In contrast, the joint space narrowing has a concordance score of only
0.36 and notice how the regression line is not even close to the line of
perfect agreement.

These data and figures come from

-   **Internet hand x-rays: A comparison of joint space narrowing and
    erosion scores (Sharp/Genant) of plain versus digitized x-rays in
    rheumatoid arthritis patients.** Arbillaga HO, Montgomery GP,
    Cabarrus LP, Watson MM, Martin L, Edworthy SM. BMC Musculoskelet
    Disord 2002: 3(1); 13.

which is an open source journal.

These tools are little publicized because the measurement of agreement
does not fit into the classical statistical models. There is no research
hypothesis, for example, but rather the goal of the research is to
assess how strongly two measures agree with one another.
