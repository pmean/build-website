**[StATS]:** **Profile analysis and MANOVA (April
18, 2005)**

> Someone asked me about profile analysis as alternative analysis to
> MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance). Typically you would use
> profile analysis when the outcome variables are measuring (more or
> less) the same thing, but possibly at different times or in different
> ways. You start by examining a profile of these measures, a graph that
> looks very similar to an interaction plot. You first test for
> parallelism by looking at a set of contrasts. If you accept the null
> hypothesis here, then you look to see if the profiles are flat, again
> using a contrast. Finally, if you accept that null hypothesis, you
> test whether the profiles are coincident (lie one on top of the
> other).
>
> Both MANOVA and profile analysis have been replaced by better and more
> flexible approaches using a mixed model analysis of variance and/or a
> random effects regression model. I want to write a web page about
> mixed models and random effects models, but have not had the time to
> do this.
