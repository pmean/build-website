**[StATS]: PowerPoint Counterpoint (March 2, 2005)**

I am a rather harsh critic of PowerPoint,

and include this brief disclaimer

in all of my training classes. One of the web resources I cite in my
criticisms of PowerPoint is

- [www.norvig.com/Gettysburg/index.htm](http://www.norvig.com/Gettysburg/index.htm)

written by Peter Norvig, a research scientist at Google. Dr. Norvig took
the text of Lincoln's Gettyburg address fed it into the PowerPoint
Autocontent Wizard, made a few tweaks, and published it on the web. It
is one of the best examples of how bad PowerPoint is for presenting
complex ideas.

I got an email today from John F. Raffensperger who felt that Dr.
Norvig's web page sent the wrong message. His argument is that we are
blaming the tool rather than the craftsman. To demonstrate this, he
reworked Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and published it at

It is an interesting presentation which makes use of public domain
pictures and music. Interestingly enough, the presentation lacks any
slide transitions, background, clip art, animation, or any other
PowerPoint effects. To me, it says that a minimalist approach to
PowerPoint (don't use anything that comes with the program) may be the
best way to use PowerPoint if you have to use it. This web site is
definitely worth viewing, especially if you want to understand the
complexities of the controversy about PowerPoint. You should also look
at Dr. Raffensperger's [suggestions to graduate students about
presentations](http://www.mang.canterbury.ac.nz/people/jfraffen/WritingSuggestions_files/PresentationSuggestions.htm).
