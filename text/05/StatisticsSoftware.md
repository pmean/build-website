**[StATS]:** **Free statistics software (September
15, 2005)**

The number and quality of free statistical software offerings appears to
be increasing. Here are two interesting sites that offer good quality
software for free.

**[Item Response Theory macros](http://anaqol.free.fr)**. Hardouin J-B.
Accessed on 2005-09-15.

> \[Excerpt\] *IRT (Item Response Theory) has been undergoing important
> developments in the past few years. Indeed, many general purpose
> statistical packages still don't have procedures implementing these
> new indices, methods and models. As a consequence, a significant
> number of specific packages have been developed by psychometricians
> (see http://www.assess.com). However, no package offers a
> comprehensive set of methods, and no package has emerged as standard
> tool in the field. The increasing sophistication of general
> statistical packages, on the other hand, allows user-written routines
> to be developed which will implement IRT methods within the context of
> an already-familiar computing environment. This site presents a set of
> macro-programs for use with Stata or SAS. While they were originally
> developed to analyse quality of life scales, they can, of course, be
> used in the area of psychometrics, test construction etc.*

**[Mx](http://www.vcu.edu/mx)**. Neale M. Accessed on 2005-09-15.

> *\[Excerpt\] Mx is a combination of a matrix algebra interpreter and a
> numerical optimizer. It enables exploration of matrix algebra through
> a variety of operations and functions. There are many built-in fit
> fuctions to enable structural equation modeling and other types of
> statistical modeling of data. It offers the fitting fuctions found in
> commercial software such as LISREL, LISCOMP, EQS and CALIS, along with
> facilities for maximum likelihood estimation of parameters from
> missing data structures, under normal theory. Complex 'nonstandard'
> models are easy to specify. For further general applicability, it
> allows the user to define their own fit functions, and optimization
> may be performed subject to linear and nonlinear equality or boundary
> constraints.* www.vcu.edu/mx
