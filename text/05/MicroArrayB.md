It\'s impossible to keep up with the flood of research on microarrays,
but here are a few articles published in the journal, Statistical
Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology that sounded interesting.
This journal, unfortunately, does not offer full free text on the web.

-   Conrad J. Burden, Yvonne E. Pittelkow, and Susan R. Wilson (2004)
    \"Statistical Analysis of Adsorption Models for Oligonucleotide
    Microarrays\", Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular
    Biology: Vol. 3: No. 1, Article 35.

-   Leslie Cope, Xiaogang Zhong, Elizabeth Garrett, and Giovanni
    Parmigiani (2004) \"MergeMaid: R Tools for Merging and Cross-Study
    Validation of Gene Expression Data\", Statistical Applications in
    Genetics and Molecular Biology: Vol. 3: No. 1, Article 29.

-   Kerby Shedden (2004) \"Confidence Levels for the Comparison of
    Microarray Experiments\", Statistical Applications in Genetics and
    Molecular Biology: Vol. 3: No. 1, Article 32.
    <http://www.bepress.com/sagmb/vol3/iss1/art32>
-   Gordon K. Smyth (2004) \"Linear Models and Empirical Bayes Methods
    for Assessing Differential Expression in Microarray Experiments\",
