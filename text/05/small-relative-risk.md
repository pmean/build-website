**[StATS]: Small relative risks (January 13, 2005)**

I found a quote on the [Skeptic's Dictionary web
site](http://skepdic.com) that is worth commenting on. The author,
Robert Todd Carroll was describing the Vioxx controversy and the lawyers
who are now aggressively recruiting people for a lawsuit against Merck,
the manufacturer of Vioxx. In it, he repeats a common misconception
about relative risk (RR):

*According to mathematician John Brignell, "In observational studies,
\[scientists\] will not normally accept an RR of less than 3 as
significant and never an RR of less than 2." \--*
[skepdic.com/refuge/funk43.html](http://skepdic.com/refuge/funk43.html)

This is a widely quoted rule, but it vastly oversimplifies the issue. A
small RR is a weaker form of evidence, because it is possible to be
swamped by even small biases and flaws in the research study. A large RR
is a stronger form of evidence, because only a huge bias or flaw could
produce an alternate explanation for these findings.

Weak evidence, however, is not the same thing as no evidence. Weak
evidence that is replicated and backed up by a credible biological
mechanism can become sufficiently persuasive.

The original source of the rule cited above is a paper by Austin
Bradford Hill published in 1965
[\[Medline\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=14283879).
It listed nine criteria that you should consider when evaluating a
research finding from observational data. It was developed during a time
when Epidemiologists had just successfully built a case linking smoking
and lung cancer on the foundation of numerous research studies, none of
which was perfect. The lessons learned in that situation became
guidelines for applying Epidemiologic principles to other toxic
exposures.

The first criterion that Hill cited, strength of association, has
unfortunately morphed into a dichotomy that all RRs smaller than 2 are
bad and all RRs larger than 2 are good, in spite of numerous cautions,
both by Hill himself in that article and by many Epidemiologists since
then.

In the classic textbook, Modern Epidemiology (Second Edition), Rothmann
and Greenland [\[BookFinder4U
link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0316757802.html) point out
(page 24) that the relationship of cigarette smoking and cardiovascular
disease is a weak association, because it is pretty hard to double the
risk of a disease that is already [responsible for about 40% of all
deaths](http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4478),
according to the American Heart Association. Nevertheless, pretty much
everyone accepts the link between smoking and cardiovascular disease. If
you relied on John Brignell's advice about relative risks less than 2
or 3, then your standard of proof would require that 80% to 120% of all
smokers would have to die from cardiovascular disease. Nothing, not even
cigarettes, can produce 120% mortality, and even 80% mortality from a
single cause is probably out of reach.

A good recent commentary on this issue is "The missed lessons of Sir
Austin Bradford Hill" by Carl Phillips and Karne Goodman.

That's my major quibble. A minor quibble is that this rule is usually
restricted, even by John Brignell, to observational studies. But the
study that showed an increase in risk for Vioxx was a randomized study.

This doesn't mean that the rest of Dr. Carroll's comments are
incorrect. It is indeed possible that we are all overreacting to weak
data. I don't think the final chapter has been written yet on Vioxx and
other drugs in its class.

A chapter of the book I am writing, [Statistical
Evidence](../evidence.asp), talks about [Corroborating
Evidence](../journal/book06.htm). This chapter mentions strength of
association, among other factors that can influence the quality of
evidence in research. I also have a weblog entry on [side
effects](http://www.pmean.com/weblog2004/SideEffects.asp)
which mentions Vioxx and other COX-2 inhibitors.

I sent an email along the same lines as this weblog entry to Dr. Carroll
and he published it on his web site at
