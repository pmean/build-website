**[StATS]:** **Selective reporting of research
findings (March 14, 2005)**

I have talked extensively about publication bias in my weblog

-   [A serious problem of publication bias (April
    9, 2004)](http://www.childrensmercy.org/stats/weblog2004/PublicationBias.asp)
-   [Publication bias (June
    25, 2004)](http://www.childrensmercy.org/stats/weblog2004/PublicationBias2.asp)
-   [Publication Bias
    references](http://www.childrensmercy.org/stats/weblog2004/PublicationBias1.asp)

and address this issue in detail on [my book on Statistical
Evidence](../evidence.asp) which I hope to finish sometime soon.

A related problem is when researchers decide to report or not report
particular data analyses based on how impressive the results appear.
This is called publication bias in situ (PBIS) by Phillips 2004.

    2004: 4(1); 20.

Examples of this problem occur when researchers have discretion in

> *(1) Which exposures and outcomes to consider in datasets with many
> variables.\
> (2) Which functional forms to use to represent variables (e.g., how to
> divide continuous variables into categories).\
> (3) Whether to conduct separate analyses by subgroup, and which
> subgroup results to emphasize.*

and they then focus their attention on that analyses which produce the
more interesting results. The more interesting results, of course, are
those results which tend to show that a new drug or therapy is better
and the less interesting results are those that tend to show that the
new drug or therapy is about the same as the standard drug or therapy. I
make a joke about this sort of thing when I tell people how wonderful
statistical software is. It allows you to run ten separate analyses and
then choose the one that gives you the smallest p-value.

Evaluating PBIS is difficult because you normally don\'t have access to
the original research protocol to see what the researchers had
originally intended.
