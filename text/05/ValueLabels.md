**[StATS]: Importing value labels from Access into
SPSS (May 24, 2005)**.

Someone asked about importing data from Access into SPSS. The Access
file has value labels (e.g., 1=Male, 2=Female, 3=Missing) and wanted to
know if there was any<U+FFFD> way to get this information into SPSS.

You cannot easily import value labels into SPSS, as far as I know. One
workaround is to use a join in Access to link the table that has the
number codes to the table that has the labels. Then export that join
into SPSS. You will get a column of data with the number codes and a
second column of data with the value labels.
