**[StATS]:** **Surrogate outcomes (March 23, 2005,
Evidence, Clinical Importance)**

I'm on the mailing list of the Alliance for Human Research
Protection, and they highlighted a book review:

- **Is Evidence-Based Medicine Evidence Based?** Bodenheimer T.
Health Affairs 2005: 24(2); 562-563.

for the book

- **Overdosed America: The Broken Promise of American Medicine**.
John Abramson (2004), HarperCollins [\[BookFinder4U
link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0060568526.html)

Other reviews of this book appears on the Blogcritics.org, about.com,
and medicalconsumers.org websites:

- [www.medicalconsumers.org/pages/OverdosedAmerica.html](http://www.medicalconsumers.org/pages/OverdosedAmerica.html)

and in JAMA

- **Overdosed America: The Broken Promise of American Medicine.**
Detsky AS. JAMA 2005: 293(10); 1271.

The author has his own website:

I have not read this book yet, but I did read several reviews. The
thing that caught my eye about the review in Health Affairs was the
description of a drug, Fosomax (alendronate) which treats
osteoporosis. Although the published literature on this drug looks
quite impressive at first, it turns out that you have to treat a large
number of women in order to prevent a single hip fracture.
Furthermore, although Fosomax improves bone mineral density (BMD), it
turns out that

*BMD mainly measures the outer layer of bone (cortical bone),
whereas much of the strength of bone lies in the inner structures of
trabecular bone. Drugs such as Fosamax primarily strengthen cortical
rather than trabecular bone, which improves the BMD score but may
not contribute as much to fracture prevention.*

This is a classic example of a surrogate outcome. Most patients don't
care about cortical or trabecular bone density. What they care about
is having to endure a broken bone or living with dowager's hump.
