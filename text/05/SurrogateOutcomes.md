> I have not read this book yet, but I did read several reviews. The
> thing that caught my eye about the review in Health Affairs was the
> description of a drug, Fosomax (alendronate) which treats
> osteoporosis. Although the published literature on this drug looks
> quite impressive at first, it turns out that you have to treat a large
> number of women in order to prevent a single hip fracture.
> Furthermore, although Fosomax improves bone mineral density (BMD), it
> turns out that
>
> > *BMD mainly measures the outer layer of bone (cortical bone),
> > whereas much of the strength of bone lies in the inner structures of
> > trabecular bone. Drugs such as Fosamax primarily strengthen cortical
> > rather than trabecular bone, which improves the BMD score but may
> > not contribute as much to fracture prevention.*
>
> This is a classic example of a surrogate outcome. Most patients don't
> care about cortical or trabecular bone density. What they care about
> is having to endure a broken bone or living with dowager's hump.
