**[StATS]:** **Using Mathematica and Matlab for
Statistics (March 22, 2005)**

[Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/introduction.html),
produced by [Wolfram Research](http://www.wolfram.com/), is a program
which performs numeric and symbolic computations. It also can produced
sophisticated graphical images. There are two books out which describe
how to use Mathematica for solving difficult problems in Mathematical
Statistics:

-   **Mathematica Laboratories for Mathematical Statistics. Emphasizing
    Simulation and Computer Intensive Methods**. Jenny A. Baglivo
    (2004), Siam Publications. [\[BookFinder4U
    link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0898715660.html)
-   Mathematical Statistics with Mathematica with CD-ROM. Colin Rose,
    Murray D. Smith (2002), Springer-Verlag. [\[BookFinder4U
    link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0387952349.html)

The latter book has a web site:

[Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/), produced by
[Mathworks](http://www.mathworks.com/), is a high level language for
solving mathematical problems. There is a book that uses Matlab for
Statistics:

-   **Computational Statistics Handbook with MATLAB**. Wendy L.
    Martinez, Angel R. Martinez (2001), CRC Press [\[BookFinder4U
    link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/1584882298.html)
