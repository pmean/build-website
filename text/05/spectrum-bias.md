I tried to start a page on [diagnostic
tests](../category/DiagnosticTesting.html) a while back, but have not
had the time to fully develop it. One of the important issues for
diagnostic tests is spectrum bias.

The sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test can depend on who
exactly is being tested. Think of disease as a range of possibilities
from slight to moderate to extreme. If only a portion of the disease
range is included, you may get an incorrect impression of how well a
diagnostic test works. This is known as spectrum bias.

The most obvious manifestation of spectrum bias is in the use of a
case-control design in studying diagnostic tests. In the case control
design, a group of patients with disease and a group of patients without
disease are asked to undergo a diagnostic test. They already know that
they have the disease, but they are asked to take the test to see how
well it performs. In a case-control design, though, you get the black
(overtly diseased) and the white (overtly healthy) but often miss out on
the gray (subtly diseased). As a result, the difference in the
diagnostic test between healthy and diseased patients is often
overstated leading to overly optimistic values for sensitivity and/or
specificity.

Much better would be to evaluate sensitivity and specificity in a cohort
design. With this design, people who have certain symptoms and who come
to a health care professional for evaluation are given a diagnostic test
and that test is compared to a gold standard (which is often just
waiting to see if the disease fully manifests itself over time). With
such a design, you are likely to get a wide range of disease states and
(hopefully) a fairer depiction of the performance of a diagnostic test.

Spectrum bias is a potential issue whenever there is heterogeneity in
the response of patients to a diagnostic test. For example, in Muhlerin
2002, the performance of an enzyme immunoassy for Chlamydia trachomatis
was shown to vary by age group. The sensitivity was much better in the
patients older than 24 years (76% vs 58%). While the specificity showed
less dramatic changes, it was also significantly higher in the older
group (99.5% versus 99.2%). With such a finding, you should be cautious
about extrapolating results of the study.

Spectrum bias can also influence other measures in a diagnostic test,
such as the ROC curve and the likelihood ratios. The way to avoid
spectrum bias is to include a broad range of disease severity in your
sample and to try to identify sources of heterogeneity in that sample.

Spectrum bias is just one of several issues that you face when you make
a critical evaluation of a research article on diagnosis. The STARD
initiative promotes good quality reporting for these type of articles
and will help you evaluate diagnostic tests properly.
