If you don't get enough email already, a new discussion group,
MedStats, was created recently. MedStats is hosted on Google Groups. The
main page for MedStats is
[groups.google.com/group/MedStats](http://groups.google.com/group/MedStats)
and details about the list appear at
[groups.google.com/group/MedStats/about](http://groups.google.com/group/MedStats/about).
Previously, these discussion groups used some type of [electronic
mailing list
software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list) and were
distributed by email. Or they were based on
[Usenet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) and people used
[newsreader software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_client) to
monitor the discussion groups. More recently, Yahoo, Google, and others
have developed web based systems that allow you to view the content of a
discussion group on the web, or you could have the contents delivered to
you by email. More details about google groups appears at
[groups-beta.google.com/googlegroups/tour/index.html](http://groups-beta.google.com/googlegroups/tour/index.html).
Information about Yahoo! Groups is at
[groups.yahoo.com/](http://groups.yahoo.com/).

As part of the FAQ for STAT-L/sci.stat.consult, I listed other
listserv/usenet groups related to statistics.

There is also a mailing list for Bioconductor. Details on how to
subscribe are at <https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/bioconductor>

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [original website][sim2].
