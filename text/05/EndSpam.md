In my job I get a lot of [spam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming),
partly because I listed my email address on my web site until just
recently. The research community is trying to find technological
solutions to spam (unsolicited commercial email), and some of the
approaches are quite fascinating. The folks at Microsoft have looked at
a system that limits the amount of email that someone can send out in a
single day by asking the sender to solve a moderately difficult
computational challenge for each piece of email sent. Emails sent out
this way would encourage the reader to open up the message, because the
sender expended a moderate amount of effort (ten seconds of CPU time) in
order to get the message to you. Such a system tells you that you are
not just one of a million different recipients of the same commercial
pitch.

Another interesting approach uses Bayesian Statistics to produce a
probability estimate that the message is spam. This approach looks at
words that appear commonly in spam messages and uncommonly in legitimate
messages.

There is a nice article about email spoofing (making an email look like
it is coming from a different person\'s account). Spoofing is a way that
spammers hide their tracks and can also be used to try to get someone in
hot water. Spoofing is illegal, but you have to track down the person
who did it, which is not always easy.

**Update: September 14, 2017**. I had originally listed some commercial
products here, but it is probably a mistake to talk about these products
without having reviewed them in detail. So I have removed those links.
