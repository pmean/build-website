**[StATS]:** **Interesting quote: From my
associations\... (September 9, 2005)** [Category:
Quotations](../category/InterestingQuotes.html)

> *\...from my associations with doctors in controlled trials I have
> learned that the better the statistician understands the
> doctor/patient relationship and the doctor\'s very real and unique
> ethical problem the better he can help to devise a trial that may be
> less than ideal experimentally but yet likely to be of some, and
> perhaps considerable, value to medicine. \...still more important, I
> have learned that though the statistician himself may never see a
> patient\... nevertheless, he cannot sit in an armchair, remote and
> Olympian, comfortably divesting himself of all ethical responsibility.
> As a partner in a combined endeavor a full share of that
> responsibility will always lie with him\...* Sir Austin Bradford Hill,
> as quoted in **Ethics and Statistics in Randomized Clinical Trials**.
> Royall RM. Statistical Science 1991; 6(1): 52-88
