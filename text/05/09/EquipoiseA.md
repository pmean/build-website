**[StATS]: Two articles debating equipoise
(September 9, 2005)** [Category: Equipoise in
research](../category/EquipoiseInResearch.html)

A frequent contributor to the IRBForum (HM) mentioned a couple of
articles that discuss equipoise and which are well worth discussing in
detail.

-   **Ethics and equipoise: rationale for a placebo-controlled study
    design of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition in coronary
    intervention.** Tcheng JE, Madan M, O\'Shea JC, Cohen EA, Buller CE,
    Lincoff AM, Popma JJ, Teirstein PS, Kitt MM, Lorenz TJ, Greenberg S,
    Fost N, Califf RM. J Interv Cardiol 2003: 16(2); 97-105.

-   **Equipoise in the Enhanced Supression of the Platelet IIb/IIIa
    Receptor with Integrilin Trial (ESPRIT): a critical appraisal.**
    Mann H, London AJ, Mann J. Clinical Trials 2005: 2; 233-243.

relevant portions of them and comment on them when I get some free time.
