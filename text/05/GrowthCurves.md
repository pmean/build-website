The New York Times has a nice article about Dr. James Tanner, an expert
on childhood growth.

-   **With His Bells and Curves, Human Growth Science Grew Up.** Hall
    SS. The New York Times, March 1, 2005.

This article contrasts the growth charts developed by Dr. Tanner with
[growth charts developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/).

Even though the CDC approach may be simplistic, it is still relies on a
very sophisticated model that allows for changes over time in the spread
of the data and in the skewness of the data.
