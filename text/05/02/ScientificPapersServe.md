**[StATS]:** **Interesting quote: Scientific papers
serve\... (February 21, 2005)** [Category:
Quotations](../category/InterestingQuotes.html)

> *\...scientific papers serve the needs of their authors above those of
> their readers. Why else would a journal devote five pages to a paper
> that reached this conclusion? \"In this pilot study, the null
> hypothesis that both treatments will show equal results cannot be
> confirmed or rejected because of the small number of participants.\"*
> Michael O\'Donnell, BMJ 2005;330:256 (29 January),
> doi:10.1136/bmj.330.7485.256-a. \[Note: I would link to this, but BMJ
> now hides most of its content after the first week of publication and
> re-opens it after one year. The paper he is quoting from is Lamers HJ
> et al. Br J Gen Pract 1998;48: 1819-23.\]
