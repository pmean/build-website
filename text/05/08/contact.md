**[StATS]:** **Contacting and working with me
(created 2005-08-15).**

This page is outdated, but I am keeping it because I am an electronic
pack rat.

Here are all the details on how you can contact me: address, phone, fax,
and email. I prefer email.

> **How to get in touch with me**
>
> Steve Simon\
> Office of Medical Research\
> Children\'s Mercy Hospital\
> 2401 Gillham Road\
> Kansas City, MO 64108
>
> Telephone: (816) 234-3963\
> FAX: (816) 855-1703\
> e-mail: ssimon (at) cmh (dot) edu
>
> If you would like to meet with me, send me an email (see above) or
> call me (see above). You can also talk to Judy Champion (816-983-6784)
> or Vicki Parker (816-234-3961) who both have the ability to check my
> schedule and make appointments.
>
> If you use Meditech to send me emails, please be sure to sign your
> message. I have a gateway program that automatically routes Meditech
> email to my Microsoft account, but it makes it impossible to use the
> REPLY key, and the return address is very cryptic. Here\'s an an
> example of one of those emails:
>
> *From: MD-LCO\@meditech.cmh.edu \[mailto:MD-LCO\@meditech.cmh.edu\]\
> Sent: Wednesday, June 30, 2004 4:28 PM\
> To: Simon, Steve, PhD\
> Subject:\
> \
> Steve, is there a software program that plots ROC curves?\
> Thanks, LCO*
>
> At this point I have to play a guessing game, because MD-LCO is not
> the most descriptive email address. Also, please be sure to include a
> subject line in your email. I get a lot of Spam, which I delete
> without reading. If your email does not have a descriptive subject
> line, I might mistakenly delete your message.
>
> **Making appointments**
>
> If I get a chance to set you up with the appropriate permissions, you
> will have the ability to review my calendar (but not make
> appointments).
>
> ![](../details/Images/consul1.gif)
>
> Â Open Microsoft Outlook and select File \| Open \|Other User\'s Folder
> from the menu.
>
> ![](../details/Images/consul2.gif)
>
> Type my name and switch from Inbox to Calendar. I\'m not the only
> Simon at Children\'s Mercy Hospital.
>
> ![](../details/Images/consul3.gif)
>
> Pick me out of the list of other Simons and click on OK. It this
> works, you\'ll be able to see my schedule.
>
> ![](../details/Images/consul5.gif)
>
> The next time around it is even easier,
>
> ![](../details/Images/consul4.gif)
>
> because you\'ll see my name on the list of choices.

**Accessing shared folders**

> If I have set up a shared folder for you, you can access it through
> the MY COMPUTER icon. Double click on this icon and select TOOLS \|
> MAP NETWORK DRIVE from the menu.
>
> ![](../details/Images/consul6.gif)
>
> The MAP NETWORK DRIVE dialog box appears
>
> ![](../details/Images/consul7.gif)
>
> It will show you the first unused letter in your list of computer
> drives and network connections. I suggest that you change this to an
> unused letter (S is probably a good choice) but you should make sure
> that whatever letter you choose isn\'t currently being used. If you
> select U, for example, you will see the following
>
> ![](../details/Images/consul8.gif)
>
> which indicates that U is already reserved for \\\\CMH\\DATA\\USERS.
> Once you have selected an unused letter, type the name of the network
> folder in the FOLDER field. It will be a name that is quite long, such
> as
>
> \\\\cmhfs1\\Groups\\Statistics Research Data\\Special Project Name
>
> where \"Special Project Name\" is replaced by the name I give you.
>
> ![](../details/Images/consul9.gif)
>
> Make sure that the check box for RECONNECT AT LOGON is selected and
> then click on the FINISH button.
>
> You can also embed the folder name as a link in a file, but you have
> to convert any blanks to a special code (%20) first. So if you create
> a link to
>
> [\\\\cmhfs1\\Groups\\Statistics%20Research%20Data\\Special%20Project%20Name](file://cmhfs1/Groups/Statistics%20Research%20Data/Special%20Project%20Name)
>
> then clicking on that link will open that folder.
>
> For any of these methods to work, you have to be connected to the CMH
> network, of course, and you have to have permission from me to access
> the particular folder.
