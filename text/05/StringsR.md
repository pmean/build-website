As part of my efforts to analyze microarray data, I am finding that I
need to do simple string manipulations in R. Here is a list of functions
that might help.

-   paste() combines several strings together into a single string.
-   substr() selects substrings.
-   format() makes a set of numbers print out more nicely.

There are several functions that will convert one string into another
string.

-   chartr() converts specific characters in a string to different
    characters.
-   tolower() converts all the letters in a string to lower case.
-   toupper() converts all the letters in a string to upper case.
-   casefold() will perform either of the two conversions shown above.

Several functions help find matches between two lists.

-   a %in% b returns a logical value of TRUE for each value of a which
    can be found somewhere in list b and FALSE if that value cannot be
    found.
-   pmatch(), match(), charmatch() work similarly but with subtle
    variations.

Several functions will use regular expressions.

-   grep() searches for matches to a pattern.
-   strsplit() splits a string into several pieces.

A nice tutorial, by the way, on regular expressions is at:

-   [en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Perl\_Regular\_expressions](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Perl_Regular_expressions)

There are several string manipulation functions found in the limma
package, including

-   makeUnique() is found in the limma package and adds numbers to the
    ends of duplicate strings to give each one a unique name.
-   trimWhiteSpace() is found in the limma package and removes leading
    and trailing blanks from a string.
