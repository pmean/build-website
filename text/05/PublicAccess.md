**[StATS]:** **Public access to publications from
NIH-funded research (February 15, 2005)**

The NIH is now requesting publication in [PubMed
Central](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/) of research publications
that is supported in whole or in part by NIH grants. The authors can
designate a time delay between the appearance of the publication in the
journal itself and when the PubMed Central article is available. This
delay should be as short as possible but can be up to twelve months if
necessary. This acknowledges the economic needs of paper journals to
recoup some of their costs of publication through subscriptions while
still making available a comprehensive archive of NIH-funded research
for health care providers, educators, and the public.

I've written about [journals that make the full free text available on
the web](http://www.pmean.com/weblog2004/FullText.asp),
which makes my job as a web author so much easier. This NIH policy will
also help me find and include good relevant teaching example of real
research.
