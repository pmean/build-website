**[StATS]:** **Free statistics software (September
15, 2005)**

The number and quality of free statistical software offerings appears to
be increasing. Here are two interesting sites that offer good quality
software for free.

**[Item Response Theory macros](http://anaqol.free.fr)**. Hardouin J-B.
Accessed on 2005-09-15.

\[Excerpt\] *IRT (Item Response Theory) has been undergoing important
developments in the past few years. Indeed, many general purpose
statistical packages still don't have procedures implementing these
new indices, methods and models. As a consequence, a significant
number of specific packages have been developed by psychometricians
(see http://www.assess.com). However, no package offers a
comprehensive set of methods, and no package has emerged as standard
tool in the field. The increasing sophistication of general
statistical packages, on the other hand, allows user-written routines
to be developed which will implement IRT methods within the context of
an already-familiar computing environment. This site presents a set of
macro-programs for use with Stata or SAS. While they were originally
developed to analyse quality of life scales, they can, of course, be
used in the area of psychometrics, test construction etc.*

**[Mx](http://www.vcu.edu/mx)**. Neale M. Accessed on 2005-09-15.

*\[Excerpt\] Mx is a combination of a matrix algebra interpreter and a
numerical optimizer. It enables exploration of matrix algebra through
a variety of operations and functions. There are many built-in fit
fuctions to enable structural equation modeling and other types of
statistical modeling of data. It offers the fitting fuctions found in
commercial software such as LISREL, LISCOMP, EQS and CALIS, along with
facilities for maximum likelihood estimation of parameters from
missing data structures, under normal theory. Complex 'nonstandard'
models are easy to specify. For further general applicability, it
allows the user to define their own fit functions, and optimization
may be performed subject to linear and nonlinear equality or boundary
constraints.* www.vcu.edu/mx
