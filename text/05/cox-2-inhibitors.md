**[StATS]: Side effects of Cox-2 inhibitors
(February 15, 2005)**

There has been so much published about side effects of Cox-2 inhibitors
that it is hard to keep up with the evolving story. Here are a few
recently released articles:

- Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Celecoxib in a Clinical Trial
for Colorectal Adenoma Prevention (DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa050405).
- Complications of the COX-2 Inhibitors Parecoxib and Valdecoxib after
Cardiac Surgery. (DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa050330).
- Cardiovascular Events Associated with Rofecoxib in a Colorectal
Adenoma Chemoprevention Trial. (DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa050493).
- COX-2 Inhibitors \-- A Lesson in Unexpected Problems. (DOI
10.1056/NEJMe058038).
- COX-2 Inhibitors \-- Lessons in Drug Safety (DOI
10.1056/NEJMe058042).
- Meta-analysis of Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors and Their Effects on
Blood Pressure. (DOI 10.1001/archinte.165.5.IOI50013).

The first five are early release publications from the New England
Journal of Medicine. The last is an early release publication from the
Archives of Internal Medicine. For some reason, I could not get the
Digital Object Identifiers to resolve properly. I'll wait a few days
and try again.

I had commented about this issue in an earlier weblog entry:
