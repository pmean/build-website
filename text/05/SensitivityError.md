A group of residents wanted me to look at an article because they were
confused about the calculation of the likelihood ratio. The numbers that
they got were quite different from those in the publication. It turns
out that they were calculating things correctly, and did not realize
that the paper had several serious errors in some of the more
fundamental calculations of sensitivity and specificity.

Here is the paper they showed me

**A clinical score to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in patients
with sore throat.** McIsaac WJ, White D, Tannenbaum D, Low DE. Cmaj
1998: 158(1); 75-83.
[Abstract]](http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/abstract/158/1/75)

This paper developed a score to assign to patients who came in
complaining of a sore throat to see if they needed to be prescribed
antibiotics. The scale was computed using the following formula:

Although scores of -1 and 5 and theoretically possible, no one scored
below zero or above 4. The paper suggests the following management
strategy:

The results of this score were compared to the physicians subjective
evaluation and to a throat swab culture (the gold standard). There are
several errors in the calculations of sensitivity and specificity in
this paper, but the most obvious one is the claim that:

*Among children aged 3 to 14 years, there was no difference between
the 2 approaches in the proportion receiving antibiotics or from whom
throat swabs were obtained, but significantly more cases of GAS
infection would have been identified with the score approach (96.9%)
than with usual physician care (70.6%) (p < 0.05). Physician
specificity was higher, however (91.7% v. 67.2%) (p < 0.05). Among
adults the sensitivity of physician judgement and of the score
approach were similar, but both throat swab use (37.3% v. 26.4%) and
antibiotic prescription (16.5% v. 3.4%) would have been reduced with
the score approach (p < 0.001).*

This data is corroborated in Table 3, where the sensitivity for patients
aged 3-14 years is reported as 96.9% (31/32) and specificity as 94.3%
(413/438). An excerpt from the table is reproduced below.

The residents could not reproduce these numbers because they were
looking instead at Table 4, a portion of which is reproduced below.

Can you spot the error in the sensitivity and specificity calculations?
