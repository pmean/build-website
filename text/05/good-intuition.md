One definition of Evidence Based Medicine is

*the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best
evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.
The practice of evidence based medicine means integrating individual
clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence
from systematic research.* [Sackett et al
1996](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/312/7023/71).

In the same article, the authors point out that

*Good doctors use both individual clinical expertise and the best
available external evidence, and neither alone is enough. Without
clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannised by evidence,
for even excellent external evidence may be inapplicable to or
inappropriate for an individual patient. Without current best
evidence, practice risks becoming rapidly out of date, to the
detriment of patients.*

A recently published book by Malcolm Gladwell highlights the value of
individual expertise, which you might also call clinical judgment or
simply intuition.

The author describes his book

*It's a book about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that
happens in a blink of an eye. When you meet someone for the first
time, or walk into a house you are thinking of buying, or read the
first few sentences of a book, your mind takes about two seconds to
jump to a series of conclusions. Well, "Blink" is a book about those
two seconds, because I think those instant conclusions that we reach
are really powerful and really important and, occasionally, really
good. You could also say that it's a book about intuition, except
that I don't like that word. In fact it never appears in "Blink."
Intuition strikes me as a concept we use to describe emotional
reactions, gut feelings\--thoughts and impressions that don't' seem
entirely rational. But I think that what goes on in that first two
seconds is perfectly rational. It's thinking\--its just thinking that
moves a little faster and operates a little more mysteriously than the
kind of deliberate, conscious decision-making that we usually
associate with "thinking." In "Blink" I'm trying to understand
those two seconds. What is going on in inside our heads when we engage
in rapid cognition? When are snap judgments good and when are they
not? What kinds of things can we do to make our powers of rapid
cognition better?*

I have not yet read the book, but it sounds like a good counterpoint to
the belief that a careful, thoughtful, rational analysis is always best.

Here are some of the references that suggest the opposite viewpoint,
that intuition is not as good as a careful analysis. Some of these I
have read, and others were recommended to me just recently.

and Decision Making**. Robyn Dawes and [\[BookFinder4U

I'd like to write up a few examples of how our intuition often fails
us, especially when we really on [anecdotal
evidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence). I touch on
this briefly in my speech, [Is the randomized trial the gold standard
for
research?](http://www.pmean.com/weblog2004/GoldStandard.asp).
