**[StATS]:** **A nice definition of anecdotal
evidence (created 2005-10-24)**.

Robert Todd Carroll, author of The Skeptics Dictionary [\[BookFinder4U
link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0471272426.html) and creator
of the website [Skepdic.com](http://www.skepdic.com), mentioned in a
recent newsletter that he has updated his definition for [anecdotal
evidence](http://www.skepdic.com/testimon.html). He points out that
anecdotes are unreliable because they  are

> *prone to contamination by beliefs, later experiences, feedback,
> selective attention to details, and so on.*

and although these are \"scientifically worthless\", their vivid details
make them popular. But Dr. Carroll wisely does not totally rule out
their use. A physician, he explains should listen to anecdotal evidence
from individual patients, but has to be careful.

> *But the physician cannot be selective in listening to testimony,
> listening only to those claims that fit his or her own prejudices.*

Dr. Carroll also provides some other good definitions for related terms,
and I am including the first sentence from each definition since they
are so well written.

-   **[Confirmation bias](http://www.skepdic.com/confirmbias.html)**: 
    *Confirmation bias refers to a type of selective thinking whereby
    one tends to notice and to look for what confirms one\'s beliefs,
    and to ignore, not look for, or undervalue the relevance of what
    contradicts one\'s beliefs.*
-   **[Selective thinking](http://www.skepdic.com/selectiv.html)**:
    *Selective thinking is the process whereby one selects out favorable
    evidence for remembrance and focus, while ignoring unfavorable
    evidence for a belief.*
-   **[Subjective
    validation](http://www.skepdic.com/subjectivevalidation.html)**:
    *Subjective validation is the process of validating words, initials,
    statements or signs as accurate because one is able to find them
    personally meaningful and significant.*

A good book that Dr. Carroll cites, and which I have mentioned on
several of my webpages is:

-   **How We Know What Isn\'t So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in
    Everyday Life.** Gilovich T (1991) New York: The Free Press. ISBN:
    0029117062. [\[BookFinder4U
    link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0029117062.html)

Dr. Carroll also mentions another book, co-authored by Gilovich, \"Why
Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes and How to Correct Them: Lessons
From the New Science of Behavioral Economics\" [\[BookFinder4U
link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0684859386.html) that I have
not yet read, but which sounds very interesting.
