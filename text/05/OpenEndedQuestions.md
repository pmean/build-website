**[StATS]: Open-ended questions on a survey (March
25, 2005)**

No one seems to talk about how to handle those pesky open-ended
questions you see on a survey. I usually hold my breath and hope that
the researcher doesn\'t think to mention it. Alicia O\'Cathain and Kate
Thomas address this important issue in a recently published article,

-   **\"Any other comments?\" Open questions on questionnaires - a bane
    or a bonus to research?** O\'Cathain A, Thomas KJ. BMC Med Res
    Methodol 2004: 4(1); 25.

and they gently scold us for ignoring an important source of
information.

What should you do with this data?

> *General open questions may produce little more than the closed
> questions on the questionnaire and rather than considering it
> unethical to analyse these responses, a more appropriate strategy
> might be preliminary analysis involving reading the responses so that
> the researcher can consider the contribution they make to the study
> overall. If the comments merely corroborate or slightly elaborate upon
> the answers to closed questions, then formal analysis may not be
> worthwhile \[23\]. It may be good practice to report within
> publications that the responses to the general open question did not
> provide additional information to the closed questions. It is where
> they offer insights or issues not available in the closed questions
> that formal analysis could be considered good practice, even if the
> role of this analysis is to identify hypotheses or questions for
> further study. Formal analysis may be prompted by either the strength
> of numbers making particular comments, or the strength of feeling
> within a small number of the comments.*

A first step is to see if those who responded to the open ended question
differ in their demographics from those who did not. O\'Cathain and Kate
Thomas cite an example of a nursing survey where the proportion of open
ended respondents increased among those who were dissatisfied with their
jobs.

The authors also suggest content analysis.

> *Content analysis may be undertaken where the researcher takes the
> following steps:*
>
> *1. Reads a sub-set of the comments.*
>
> *2. Devises a coding frame to describe the thematic content of the
> comments.*
>
> *3. Assigns the codes to all the comments. The coding frame can be
> applied using software designed for this purpose or manually. Two
> coders may be needed to test the reliability of assigning codes.*
>
> *4. The codes can be entered into a statistical package alongside the
> data from the closed questions and treated as variables in a
> quantitative analysis.*

This is not exactly a formal qualitative analysis, but it is similar
enough that you may want to consult with an expert in this area.

You can and should use quote of particular comments that give your
reader an idea of what the general tenor of the comments was like. Be
sure, though, that you don\'t include any information that might violate
patient confidentiality.
