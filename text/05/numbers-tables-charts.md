**[StATS]:** **Presenting Numbers, Tables, and
Charts (April 15, 2005)**

I got a nice email from Sally Bigwood, one of the coauthors of

- **Presenting Numbers, Tables, and Charts** Sally Bigwood, Melissa
Spore. Oxford University Press - January 2003. [\[BookFinder4U
link\]](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0198607229.html)

a book which I have not read, but which looks very interesting. She was
commenting on my speech, [Pitch the pie! Ban the
bar!](../model/barpie.asp), which draws most of its resources from an
article by A.S.C. Ehrenberg that appeared long ago in the American
Statistician

- **The Problem of Numeracy.** Ehrenberg ASC. The American
Statistician 1981: 35(1); 67-71.

as well as two books that he wrote

- **Data Reduction Analysing & Interpreting Statistical Data.**
Ehrenberg ASC (1975) New York: John Wiley & Sons.
- **A Primer in Data Reduction.** Ehrenberg ASC (1982) New York: John
Wiley & Sons.

It turns out that Sally Bigwood had had several discussions with Dr.
Ehrenberg that helped in writing the book. She and Melissa Spore also
have a website

- **[Plain Figures](http://www.plainfigures.com%20)**. Bigwood S,
Spore M. Accessed on 2005-04-15. www.plainfigures.com

that offers some interesting and helpful guidance.

If I ever get the time, I want to convert and update a presentation,
Guidelines for Good Graphics, which is now a Word document, into HTML
format.
