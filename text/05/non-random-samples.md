**[StATS]: Non-random samples (March 25, 2005)**

Someone sent me an email asking about a project that involved interviews
of women at higher levels of management in an organization. This is a
rather small group, and might require a non-random selection process.
What are the limitations of a non-random sample?

It helps to remember the definition of a random sample. This is a subset
of a population where every individual in the population has an equal
probability of being in the subset. This is an ideal that is almost
never achieved, even with the most careful research.

If your sample is not random, you have to ask yourself "What type of
women would be left out, or would have a much lower probability of being
in my sample?" It could be that women who work at remote sites, work at
home, or who work odd hours, would be the ones that you would have no
chance, or a lower chance of selecting in your sample.

Next, you have to make an assessment (usually a subjective assessment)
of how the outcome measure might change in the group of women who are
underrepresented or unrepresented in your sample.

In medicine, we often require some level of stability in the lives of
the patients that we study. They have to live in the same place for at
least six months or a year. So patients who move a lot are much less
likely to be in our sample. What sort of person moves a lot? Often (but
not always) it is someone who is living on the lower rungs of the
socioeconomic ladder. They are often marginally employed and they have
to go where the jobs are. For children, they may have to move because
they are being shuttled from relative to relative because of the
difficult economic circumstances of their caregivers.

When you tend to exclude patients with lower socioeconomic
circumstances, you are excluding patients who have, in general, a poorer
prognosis. As a result, you may end up looking at your results through
rose colored glasses.

Whether you choose a random or a non-random sample depends on the
balance between the difficulty and cost associated with a random sample
versus the limitations that you have to endure with a non-random sample.
This is often a difficult choice and depends quite a bit on your
subjective assessments and your values. Of course, when a random sample
is impossible, your choice is made for you.

I have some definitions of various types of samples on my web pages:

- [Convenience
sample](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/convenience.htm)
- [Random sample](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/random.htm)
- [Quota sample](www.childrensmercy.org/definitions/quota.htm)
