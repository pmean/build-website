**[StATS]:** **Tolerance limits (created
2005-04-15)**.

Someone asked me about the difference between control limits and
tolerance limits.

I have a [web page about quality control models](../model/quality.asp)
that talks a bit about control limits for a control chart. The word
"tolerance" is ambiguous and could mean several things. There is a
formal tolerance interval which is a confidence interval for percentile
limits of a distribution.

In another context, tolerance limit might represent an engineering
specification, where values inside the limit represent parts that will
work reliably in the machine or product.

Donald Wheeler talks about specification limits and the voice of the
customer. That may be a more desirable choice of language. You could
also distinguish between internally derived limits (typically from
control charts) and externally derived limits (possibly derived from a
consensus control chart, possibly derived by a probability model,
possibly derived by ad hockery).
