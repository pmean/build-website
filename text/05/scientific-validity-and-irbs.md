One of the regular posters on the edstat-l mailing list shared a comment
that is commonly held among many of the people I have talked to.

*IRB's should NOT be in the business of trying to make studies good.
IRBs are not sufficiently experts in all the different kinds of
proposals that come across their desks. They are there to make sure
that the principles of informed consent and lack of coercion \... have
been faithfully taken care of.*

This comment is a reaction to the tendency of some IRBs to nitpick.
While I am somewhat sympathetic to overly intrusive reviews that we all
have to endure, it is important to remember the underlying rationale for
IRB review of scientific validity.

Suppose the research study involves collection of cerebrospinal fluid
through a painful procedure known as lumbar puncture. If I were going to
participate in such a study, I'd like to have some assurance that the
study was "good." And I wouldn't want to trust the researchers
themselves. Far too often they have a financial stake in the research or
they are so enthusiastic about their work that they lose a sense of
perspective. In my mind, some sort of external review of the quality of
the study would be mandated anytime human subjects are involved, and the
level of that review should be commensurate with the risks that I am
undertaking.

It's hard for an IRB to find the right balance between making sure that
the research is of sufficient quality to justify the risks and
inconveniences that a research subject has to endure. Too much review
and too little review are both bad.
