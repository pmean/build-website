**[StATS]: Determining the optimal threshold for a
diagnostic test (April 27, 2005)**

> Someone asked me about how to design an experiment that would use the
> ROC curve to determine an appropriate threshold for a diagnostic test.
>
> The first thing to consider is how you would collect a sample of
> patients. The simplest approach, but the weakest from an evidentiary
> viewpoint, is to use a case-control design. A case-control design
> selects patients on the basis of an outcome, such patients admitted to
> a hospital for jaundice. These are the cases, and then a control group
> (non-cases) is selected separately. The control group is similar in
> all respects to the cases, except the controls do not have the
> outcome.
>
> The problem with a case control approach here is that this design
> usually does not allow for the full spectrum of the disease (spectrum
> bias). Instead, obvious cases are compared to obvious non-cases. This
> type of design is well known to overstate sensitivity and specificity.
>
> A second approach that works better is to select a cross-sectional
> sample, and administer the diagnostic test and a gold standard at the
> same time to each patient.
>
> A third approach that also works well is to select a cohort of
> patients, give all of them the test, and then watch over a period of
> time to see which ones develop the outcome that the diagnostic test is
> trying to assess.
>
> The ROC curve will help you select an appropriate cut-off for your
> test. But first you should ask the question whether a cut-off makes
> sense or not. Will clinicians need a Black/White response or will they
> tolerate shades of gray? Will they accept a test that provides a
> continuum of values or will that be perceived as too complicated or
> too messy? If they won\'t tolerate a continuum, maybe they will still
> tolerate a test that has three or four levels rather than two.
>
> Let\'s assume that the clinicians need a black/white response. A lot
> of writing on the ROC curve suggests a rather simple choice: pick the
> value where the ROC curve is closest to the upper left hand corner.
> This approach is perhaps a bit too simplistic. You need to do a
> serious assessment of the cost of a false positive result as well as
> the cost of a false negative result. To do this, ask yourself, what is
> the next step if the test is positive? if the test is negative? Think
> about the consequences if we take either step inappropriately.
>
> A good example of this is an assessment of whether the patient has
> vertebral fractures. If the test is positive, you send the patient to
> radiology for x-rays. If the test is negative, then you take off the
> cervical collar and send the patient home. A false positive means an
> unnecessary x-ray. This is not a trivial consideration, but it pales
> in the face of sending a patient home with an undetected vertebral
> fracture.
>
> Since a false negative is far worse than a false positive, we want to
> do the best possible job of ruling out a possible fracture. You want
> sensitivity to be very high, even at the expense of specificity.
> Recall the acronym SnNOut, that says that if sensitivity is high, a
> negative test helps rule out the disease.
>
> Contrast this with a diagnostic test where the next step, if the
> patient tests positive, is surgery. I would be very nervous about a
> false positive because it represents an unnecessary surgery.
>
> There are ways to select points on the ROC curve that allow for
> appropriate tradeoffs between false negatives and false positives, but
> they are difficult to describe here. The important thing, though, is
> to produce an honest assessment of the costs involved with both types
> of errors.
