I attended an excellent talk by one of the nurses at CMH on the problems
with implementing quality improvement initiatives in health care. She
cited an interesting statistics, that it takes an average of 17 years
for research findings to be implemented in clinical practice. I asked
her for the source of this statistic, and she found several references
to an article by Balas and Boren:

- **Managing clinical knowledge for health care improvement**. Balas
EA, Boren SA. In: Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2000:
Patient-Centered Systems. Stuttgart, Germany: Schattauer;
2000:65-70.

I don't have access to this article, but one publication that I do have
provides a bit more detail about this statistic.

*There has been increasing concern in the last few years about the
failure of research findings to rapidly affect clinical practice. This
failure has highlighted the difficulties clinicians encounter when
trying to implement new approaches in their practices and the relative
ineffectiveness of traditional methods such as continuing medical
education and journal publications for disseminating new medical
information. Using the results of a number of published studies, Balas
and Boren estimated that it takes an average of 17 years to turn 14%
of original research findings into changes in care that benefit
patients*. **Primary care practice-based research networks: working at
the interface between research and quality improvement.** Mold JW,
Peterson KA. Ann Fam Med 2005: 3 Suppl 1; S12-20.

This is a rather interesting statistic, and I can think of many
counterexamples where research results led to very rapid changes in
clinical practice. I can also think of examples that support this
particular statistic. I would be very curious to find out if there is
any additional research that would provide empirical support for this
statistic.
