**[StATS]:** **Registration of clinical trials (July
22, 2005)**

International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) has called
for a requirement for registration of clinical trials. All clinical
trials that start recruiting on or after July 1, 2005 must be placed
in a public registry before enrollment of the first patient. This
includes

"*trials that test a clinical hypothesis about health outcomes*"

but not phase 1 trials that only assess toxicity and/or
pharmacokinetics. There is a gray area.

"*Between these two extremes are some clinical trials whose
prespecified goal is to investigate the biology of disease or to
provide preliminary data that may lead to larger, clinically
directive trials. We recognise that requiring public registration of
trials whose prespecified goal is to investigate the biology of
disease or to direct further research might slow the forces that
drive innovation. Therefore, each journal editor will decide on a
case-by-case basis about reviewing unregistered trials in this
category. Authors whose trial is unregistered will have to convince
the editor that they had a sound rationale when they decided not to
register their trial. The ICMJE will maintain this policy for the
next two years. We will then review our experience.*"

There are twenty elements that should be part of the registration.

1.  Unique trial number
2.  Trial registration date
3.  Secondary IDs (if any)
4.  Funding source(s)
5.  Primary sponsor
6.  Secondary sponsor(s)
7.  Responsible contact person (public inquiries)
8.  Research contact person (scientific inquiries)
9.  Title of the study (can be omitted if the researchers wish).
10. Official scientific title of the study This title must include the
name of the intervention, the condition being studied, and the
outcome
11. Research ethics review
12. The medical condition being studied
13. A description of the study and comparison/control intervention(s).
The duration of the intervention(s) must be specified.
14. Key inclusion and exclusion criteria
15. Study type. This would include choices for randomised vs.
non-randomised, type of masking (eg, double-blind, single-blind),
type of controls (eg, placebo, active), and group assignment, (eg,
parallel, crossover, factorial).
16. Anticipated trial start date
17. Target sample size
18. Recruitment status Is this information available (yes/no) (If yes,
link to information).
19. Primary outcome. Description should include the time at which the
outcome is measured.
20. Key secondary outcomes.
