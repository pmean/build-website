Someone gave me a data set with 549 rows of data. The first row
corresponded to observations on 06/01/2003, the second to 06/02/2003,
and so forth through 11/30/2004. She wanted to know how to get those
particular dates in a column without having to type something into each
individual cell.

Here\'s how I did it.

First, I defined a new column, date1, that has a date format. Then I
used TRANSFORM \| COMPUTE to calculate the following formula:

-   DATE.DMY(31,05,2003)+\$casenum\*24\*60\*60

 This gives you dates starting on June 1, 2003 and moving up day by day
in each row.

She also wanted a column designating the particular month. You can do
this with the same TRANSFORM \| COMPUTE command to compute a new
variable, MONTH, using the formula

-   XDATE.MONTH(date1).

Since you have June in both 2003 and 2004, you probably also need to
compute a YEAR variable using the formula

-   XDATE.YEAR(date1).

This is a very simple example of date calculations in SPSS. I have
another page that talks about this:

-   [Stats: Date calculations in SPSS](../data/dates.asp)

and version 13 of SPSS has a very useful date and time wizard:

-   [Stats: New in SPSS version 13.0 (December
    7, 2004)](http://www.childrensmercy.org/stats/weblog2004/SPSSversion13.asp)

but the best resource for these types of things is on Raynald
Levesque\'s web site:

-   **[Dates
