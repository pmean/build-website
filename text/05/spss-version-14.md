I attended a web seminar, What's New in SPSS version 14.0, taught by
Meta Brown, a Senior Systems Engineer with SPSS, Inc. Version 14 will
ship in October 2005. The major improvements in version 14.0 include

- more powerful data management (multiple data sets open in a single
SPSS session) and
- enhanced reporting (a new chart builder interface, and a graphics
production language, GPL).

in the SPSS base product, and

- easy data validation (validate across multiple variables),
- easier more powerful forecasting (an expert modeler offers
sophisticated fitting of time series models that can now incorporate
independent variables and forecast many series at once),
- extended programmability (more complex functions like flow control
and extensibility), and
- expanded structural equation modeling options (bayesian estimation
and data imputation).

in the SPSS product family.

The licensing allows first access to advanced modules to "power
users." There is also a new commuter license that allows you to borrow
a license from the network version to place on a laptop that is taken
away from the network for up to 30 days. The network license is
decreased by one user during this time, and the laptop can run SPSS
remotely. When the user returns to the network, the license is taken off
the laptop and restored to the network.

The SPSS output is now almost completely converted to the newer pivot
table format. Output Management System also allows you to export the
output in a variety of different ways.

Here are my thoughts and opinions on these improvements. I was impressed
by the data validation modules which includes a lot of common sense
checks you can apply such as

- dichotomy (0-1),
- dichotomy (1-2),
- likert scale (1-5),
- non-negative number,
- non-negative integer,
- range (0 to 100),

and you can add additional rules. Simply tell SPSS what rules apply to
which variables and then SPSS will highlight how many violations occur
and where they occur.

The chart builder seemed a bit gimmicky to me and the process seemed to
encourage the use of pseudo 3D effects that most statisticians despise.
I am also cautious about "expert modelers" because computers can't
match the efficiency and insights of a human. This is slowly changing
though, and when the computer "expert modelers" catch up with their
human counterparts, I will probably have to retire.

There wasn't a lot on the graphics programming language but this looks
like something I would enjoy working with.
