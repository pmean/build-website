> *\...from my associations with doctors in controlled trials I have

> doctor/patient relationship and the doctor's very real and unique
> ethical problem the better he can help to devise a trial that may be
> less than ideal experimentally but yet likely to be of some, and
> perhaps considerable, value to medicine. \...still more important, I
> have learned that though the statistician himself may never see a

> Olympian, comfortably divesting himself of all ethical responsibility.
> As a partner in a combined endeavor a full share of that
> responsibility will always lie with him\...* Sir Austin Bradford Hill,
