**[StATS]:** **Taguchi methods (created
2005-02-22)**.

[Genichi Taguchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genichi_Taguchi) was a
Japanese engineer and statistician who developed a wide range of
statistical tools for improving the quality of industrial manufacturing.
These tools are collectively known as [Taguchi
methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taguchi_methods). One of the most
powerful of these tools is robust product design. In this design,
certain manufacturing parameters are varied in an inner array, and
environmental parameters are varied in an outer array. The goal is to
find a combination of manufacturing parameters that perform well (on
target with minimal variation) across all of the environmental
parameters. Such a combination is robust across the range of conditions
that the product might be used at.

An excellent summary appears in [section
5.5.6](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pri/section5/pri56.htm)
of the [Engineering Statistics
Handbook](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm) published
by the [U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology](http://www.nist.gov/).
