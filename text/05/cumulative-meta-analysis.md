shows cumulative meta-analysis, which is the cumulated effects over time
of studies in the use of erythropoietin (EPO) to treat cancer related
anemia. The outcome variable, the odds ratio for whether a patient
requires transfusion, showed a significant benefit for EPO and that
sufficient evidence had already accumulated by 1995. If such a
meta-analysis had been performed back then, there would have been no
need to run the additional trials. These redundant trials are bad
because they wasted scarce research dollars on a topic where sufficient
information had already been accumulated to answer the research
question. They are also bad because half of the patients in these
post-1995 trials received no treatment or placebo, even though there was
enough evidence at that time to show that this is an inferior option.

There has been a suggestion that any protocol submitted to an
Institutional Review Board (IRB) should include a systematic overview or
meta-analysis of the previous research (see Chalmers 1996), rather than
just a simple literature review, to prevent future IRBs from making the
same mistake of those that approved the post-1995 studies of EPO. In
some situations, that is definitely overkill, but it is a suggestion
worth serious consideration in other circumstances.
