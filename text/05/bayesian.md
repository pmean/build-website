I . "Should proponents of EBM be concerned about understanding the Bayesian philosophy? In my opinion, no. I think we'll gradually see Bayesian philosophy creep in to the design and analysis of clinical trials. For example, there are good Bayesian solutions, I understand, to the tricky issue of early stopping of clinical trials. But I doubt that we will see a wholesale rejection of both p-values AND confidence intervals in my lifetime. Too many people like me fail to fully understand the Bayesian paradigm for this to happen. So from a practical viewpoint, most of the medical research for the foreseeable future will be analyzed using the Frequentist paradigm."

John Platt recently mentioned two paper on the same list.

I also got an email encouraging me to write about Bayesian Statistics from Bill Jefferys. He suggested Tom Loredo's ["Bayesian Inference for the Physical Sciences"][lor1] (BIPS) page as a good resource.

Another good source of information is an article in the Journal of Statistics Education, which is available on the web.
