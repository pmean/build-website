****[StATS]:** Steps in a typical Bayesian model
(January 24, 2005)**

I editorialized a year ago about this on the evidence-based Health List.
\"Should proponents of EBM be concerned about understanding the Bayesian
philosophy? In my opinion, no. I think we\'ll gradually see Bayesian
philosophy creep in to the design and analysis of clinical trials. For
example, there are good Bayesian solutions, I understand, to the tricky
issue of early stopping of clinical trials. But I doubt that we will see
a wholesale rejection of both p-values AND confidence intervals in my
lifetime. Too many people like me fail to fully understand the Bayesian
paradigm for this to happen. So from a practical viewpoint, most of the
medical research for the foreseeable future will be analyzed using the
Frequentist paradigm.\"

John Platt recently mentioned two paper on the same list. Goodman Toward
Evidence-Based Medical Statistics. 1: The P Value Fallacy Annals of
Internal Medicine, 15 June 1999. 130:995-1004. Steven N. Goodman, MD,
PhD Toward Evidence-Based Medical Statistics. 2: The Bayes Factor Annals
of Internal Medicine, 15 June 1999. 130:1005-1013.

I also got an email encouraging me to write about Bayesian Statistics
from Bill Jefferys. He suggested Tom Loredo\'s \"Bayesian Inference for
the Physical Sciences\" (BIPS) page as a good resource.\

Another good source of information is an article in the Journal of
Statistics Education, which is available on the web.
