One definition of Evidence Based Medicine is

> *the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best
> evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.
> The practice of evidence based medicine means integrating individual
> clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence
> from systematic research.* [Sackett et al
> 1996](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/312/7023/71).

In the same article, the authors point out that

> *Good doctors use both individual clinical expertise and the best
> available external evidence, and neither alone is enough. Without
> clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannised by evidence,
> for even excellent external evidence may be inapplicable to or
> inappropriate for an individual patient. Without current best
> evidence, practice risks becoming rapidly out of date, to the
> detriment of patients.*

A recently published book by Malcolm Gladwell highlights the value of
individual expertise, which you might also call clinical judgment or
simply intuition.

The author describes his book

> *It\'s a book about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that
> happens in a blink of an eye. When you meet someone for the first
> time, or walk into a house you are thinking of buying, or read the
> first few sentences of a book, your mind takes about two seconds to
> jump to a series of conclusions. Well, \"Blink\" is a book about those
> two seconds, because I think those instant conclusions that we reach
> are really powerful and really important and, occasionally, really
> good. You could also say that it\'s a book about intuition, except
> that I don\'t like that word. In fact it never appears in \"Blink.\"
> Intuition strikes me as a concept we use to describe emotional
> reactions, gut feelings\--thoughts and impressions that don\'t\' seem
> entirely rational. But I think that what goes on in that first two
> seconds is perfectly rational. It\'s thinking\--its just thinking that
> moves a little faster and operates a little more mysteriously than the
> kind of deliberate, conscious decision-making that we usually
> associate with \"thinking.\" In \"Blink\" I\'m trying to understand
> those two seconds. What is going on in inside our heads when we engage
> in rapid cognition? When are snap judgments good and when are they
> not? What kinds of things can we do to make our powers of rapid
> cognition better?*

I have not yet read the book, but it sounds like a good counterpoint to
the belief that a careful, thoughtful, rational analysis is always best.

Here are some of the references that suggest the opposite viewpoint,
that intuition is not as good as a careful analysis. Some of these I
have read, and others were recommended to me just recently.

    and Decision Making**. Robyn Dawes and [\[BookFinder4U

I\'d like to write up a few examples of how our intuition often fails
us, especially when we really on [anecdotal
evidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence). I touch on
this briefly in my speech, [Is the randomized trial the gold standard
for
research?](http://www.pmean.com/weblog2004/GoldStandard.asp).
