**[StATS]:** **Interesting quote: You have to
make\...\... (May 16, 2005)** [Category:
Quotations](../category/InterestingQuotes.html)

> *\"*You have to make a distinction between the science and the
> technological applications,*\" says Francis Fukuyama, a member of the
> President\'s Council on Bioethics and director of the Human
> Biotechnology Governance Project. \"*It\'s probably true that in terms
> of the basic science, it\'s pretty hard to stop that. It\'s not one
> guy in a laboratory somewhere. But not everything that is
> scientifically possible will actually be technologically implemented
> and used on a large scale. In the case of human cloning, there\'s an
> abstract possibility that people will want to do that, but the number
> of people who are going to want to take the risk is going to be
> awfully small.*\" Taboos will play an important role, Fukuyama says.
> \"*We could really speed up the whole process of drug improvement if
> we did not have all the rules on human experimentation. If companies
> were allowed to use clinical trials in Third World countries, paying a
> lot of poor people to take risks that you wouldn\'t take in a
> developed country, we could speed up technology quickly. But because
> of the Holocaust \-- *\" Fukuyama thinks the school of hard knocks
> will slow down a lot of attempts. \"*People may in the abstract say
> that they\'re willing to take that risk. But the moment you have a
> deformed baby born as a result of someone trying to do some genetic
> modification, I think there will be a really big backlash against
> it.*\"* quoted in the Washington Post article, \"Inventing Our
> Evolution\" published Monday, May 16, 2005 at
