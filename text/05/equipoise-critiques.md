Vital to the ethical conduct of a clinical trial is the concept of
equipoise, that a researcher is clinically indifferent or genuinely
uncertain, as to whether a new therapy is better than the standard
therapy.

Stephen Senn is a harsh critic of the concept of equipoise and points
out the reality that most researchers go into a study with a belief that
the new therapy being tested is better.

*Equipoise is an irrelevance. Patients are entered onto the trial
because the trialists believe that the experimental treatment is
better. The control group treatment should be as good as that
available outside the trial. Experimentation continues until either
the trialists are convinced they are wrong (equipoise is reached) or
they convince Society they are right.* \-- [Senn
(2000)](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/321/7258/442#9231).

The FDA comments on equipoise are less extreme than Dr. Senn's but
still echo the same sentiment.

*Indeed, true neutrality is rarely present at the start of an
investigation; in the absence of expectation that an intervention may
represent an improvement, or a belief that a standard therapy might
not work, there is little incentive to proceed. The experienced
clinical investigator, however, also knows that expectations are not
the same as knowledge and that disappointments are too common to
ignore. Therefore, despite optimistic expectations, one can be in the
state of equipoise needed to allow a clinical investigation to be
conducted.* \--

I had included both of these quotes before in a web page about placebos,
but I did not realize until just now that this is in diametric
opposition to a claim by Djulbegovic

*FINDINGS: Trials funded solely or in part by 35 profit-making
organisations had a trend toward higher quality scores (mean 2.94 \[SD
1.3\]; median 3) than randomised trials supported by 95 governmental
or other non-profit organisations (2.4 \[0.8\]; 2; p=0.06). Overall,
the uncertainty principle was upheld, with 44% of randomised trials
favouring standard treatments and 56% innovative treatments (p=0.17);
mean and median preference evaluation scores were 3.7 (1.0) and 4.
However, when the analysis was done according to the source of
funding, studies funded by non-profit organisations maintained
equipoise favouring new therapies over standard ones (47% vs 53%;
p=0.608) to a greater extent than randomised trials supported solely
or in part by profit-making organisations (74% vs 26%; p=0.004).
INTERPRETATION: The reported bias in research sponsored by the
pharmaceutical industry may be a consequence of violations of the
uncertainty principle. Sponsors of clinical trials should be
encouraged to report all results and to choose appropriate comparative
controls.* [Djulbegovic
2000](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=10968436).

Perhaps this 74/26 split is a reflection, not of publication bias, not
of choice of inappropriate controls, but rather the intelligence of the
research planners who work for commercial sponsors. This is not to say
that publication bias does not exist, or that bad controls are not
sometimes deliberately chosen. It's just that if I were a drug company,
I would want to hire people who, because of their intuition and good
sense, investigate new drugs that have a good chance of actually
working.
