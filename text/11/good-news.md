I got an email three days ago from my contact at Cambridge University Press. It looks like they want to publish my book!

<!---More--->

I got two reviews that were mostly positive and offered some constructive suggestions. It's not official yet, but I should be getting a contract to sign in early January.

I wrote up all the details about my book proposal for my website and then shared them with several publishers. My original intention was to prepare formal proposals to several publishers in 2011, but Cambridge took my webpages as is and submitted them to reviewers and beat the other publishers to the punch. So now I have a different resolution: write the roughly 60,000 words that I need to complete this book.
