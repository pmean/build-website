I was approached by a member of the planning committee for the [American Statistical Association Conference on Statistical Practice][csp1] about giving a talk at that conference. The talk would be an extension of a roundtable discussion I am giving at the [Joint Statistical Meetings][jsm1] in 2011, [Using Email Newsletters, Webinars, Blogs, And Social Media To Promote Your Consulting Career][sim3]. After a telephone call this morning, I offered to prepare an abstract of a talk that I might give at this conference. I'm very flexible on the content of this talk, but I thought it would be a good idea to put my thoughts down in writing.

Title: Promoting your consulting career in the era of Web 2.0. Speaker: Steve Simon, P.Mean Consulting and Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, University of Missouri-Kansas City. Abstract: Web 2.0, defined by Wikipedia as "web applications that facilitate participatory information sharing, interoperability, user-centered design, and collaboration on the World Wide Web" offers new opportunities for you to promote your consulting career. These tools are mostly free or very inexpensive, though they are labor intensive. In this talk, I will describe some Web 2.0 tools that I have used to promote my independent consulting career (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), as well as some of the unwritten rules about appropriate usage of these tools. I will contrast these tools with simpler Internet methods (static websites, email newsletters) and some non-computer methods that can help promote your consulting career. Web 2.0 will not replace more traditional modes of career promotion, but it offers some unique opportunities to supplement these efforts.
