This page is obsolete. I am keeping it around for nostalgic reasons.

I have been thinking for a while about simplifying my billing practices for independent statistical consulting. There are a lot of reasons for doing this, but mostly it makes things simpler for me and my customers. Nothing's official yet, but here's a brief description of the proposed revision in billing.

One policy that won't change is that I offer the first hour of consulting for free.

Note (2024-06-25): I never completed a description of my flat rate policy. I still charge by the hour.
