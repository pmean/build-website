I'm asked often to provide a short biography that can be used as an introduction to a talk I am giving. Anything that I pass along to an introducer I also post on my website. I have versions written in 2009, 2008, 2004, and 2002. I also have a resume on the web (head hunters, please note that I am not looking for a job) and a PHS 398 biosketch in the new format. Here's the latest biography. Feel free to use or not use anything listed here or elsewhere. I am very open minded about what or what is not included in an introduction about me (flattery is indeed appreciated, though). I include this information because I know how hard it is to find the right thing to say when I am doing the introducing, so I want to make your job easier if you are introducing me.

Steve Simon earned a Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Iowa in 1982. He has been author or co-author on over 80 peer-reviewed publications, four of which have won major awards. The R code that he wrote for a Bayesian model for patient accrual won an honorable mention award in the Revolution Analytics "Applications of R in Business" contest. He has written one book, Statistical Evidence in Medical Trials, and has a contract to write a second book. He is the author of a major website about Statistics, Research Design, and Evidence Based Medicine: www.pmean.com. He also publishes an email newsletter, The Monthly Mean, with over 400 subscribers.

Dr. Simon has worked at an academic consulting center at three locations in three different decades. He has also worked as a consultant at a federal research agency and at a children's hospital. He is currently spending half his time as an independent consultant and half his time setting up a new consulting service at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

Here's a slightly different version that I used to pitch a talk about a Bayesian model for patient accrual.

I earned a Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Iowa in 1982. I currently work as an independent statistical consultant and am a part-time faculty member in the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. I have written one book, Statistical Evidence in Medical Trials, and am the author of a major website about Statistics, Research Design, and Evidence Based Medicine, www.pmean.com.

I am a highly sought after speaker, and have provided numerous invited talks and short courses. as well as a popular webinar series: Statistics for Medical Librarians. I take great pride in the repeat invitations that I have gotten from many organizations. One of my current research interests and the proposed presentation topic is Bayesian models to plan and monitor patient accrual in clinical trials. It is an easy to follow talk on an area important with many members of your audience.
