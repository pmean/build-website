I was asked to develop a list of webcast topics for a client working in the pharmaceutical industry. They are listed roughly in priority order for the first half. I have some handouts already for some of these classes and I have included links to those handouts when possible. These handouts would be updated, of course and I do want to target specific medical applications for this client, though, so I might swap out the some of the examples used in the small group exercises. Still, they give a rough idea of topic coverage.

### Top priority studies (listed roughly in priority order)

1. P-values, confidence intervals, and the Bayesian alternative. I would re-use or adapt material from these previous talks: [1][pva1], [2][pva2], [3][pva3], [4][pva4], [5][pva5], and [6][pva6].
2. Equivalence, non-inferiority, and superiority trials. This would be new material.
3. Exclusions, refusals, dropouts, and intention to treat analysis. I would re-use or adapt material from this previous talk: [1][exc1].
4. Odds ratios, relative risk, and the number needed to treat. I would re-use or adapt material from these previous talks: [1][odd1], [2][odd2], and [3][odd3].
5. Randomized trials. I would re-use or adapt material from these previous talks: [1][ran1], [2][ran2], [3][ran3], [4][ran4], and [5][ran5].
6. Observational studies. I would re-use or adapt material from these previous talks: [1][obs1] and [2][obs2].
7. Systematic overviews/meta-analysis. I would re-use or adapt material from these previous talks: [1][sys1], [2][sys2], and [3][sys3].

### Lower priority studies (there is no priority ordering here)

+ Conflict of interest and fraud in research. I would re-use or adapt material from this previous talk: [1][coi1].
+ Survival curves. I would re-use or adapt material from this previous talk: [1][sur1].
+ Risk adjustment models This would be new material.
+ Diagnostic tests: sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios. I would re-use or adapt material from these previous talks: [1][dia1], [2][dia2], [3][dia3], [4][dia4], and [5][dia5].
+ Selecting an appropriate sample size. I would re-use or adapt material from these previous talks: [1][sam1] and [2][sam2].
+ Simple regression models. I would re-use or adapt material from these previous talks: [1][reg1], [2][reg2], [3][reg3], and [4][reg4].
+ Hill's criteria for causation. I would re-use or adapt material from this previous talk: [1][cau1].
+ Ethics of placebo controlled trials. I would re-use or adapt material from this previous talk: [1][pla1].
+ Scientific validity and IRB review. I would re-use or adapt material from this previous talk: [1][irb1].
+ Models for missing values This would be new material.
+ Longitudinal and hierarchical models This would be new material.
+ Guidelines for Good Graphics. I would re-use or adapt material from this previous talk: [1][gra1].
+ Post marketing surveillance This would be new material.
+ Adaptive clinical trials This would be new material.
+ Questionnaire development This would be new material.
