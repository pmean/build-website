Someone who was about to embark on an independent consulting career asked me what you should put on your business card. My advice was to keep it simple.

<!---More--->

List your name and your terminal degree and the name of your company. List some of the ways to get in touch with you. This might include:

+ address
+ telephone number
+ fax number
+ skype information
+ email address
+ website
+ Facebook page
+ LinkedIn page
+ Twitter account

but don't feel like you have to list all of these. Don't list anything that might compromise your privacy; some people might not want to let a lot of people know where they live and/or their home phone number. As long as you list at least two different ways of contacting you, that should be fine.

You should consider a company logo (mine appears at the top of the page). Also consider a tag line (I don't have one, but if I did it might be something like: solving the toughest statistical problems).

If you have a company name, company logo, or company tag line, try to use it in all your business correspondance, all your emails, on your website, etc.
