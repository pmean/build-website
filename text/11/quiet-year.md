I was asked by my boss to document my scholarly activities for the past year. I used July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011 as the time frame (I don't anticipate a lot happening in the next 30 days). Here's what I wrote.

<!---More--->

From July 2010 through June 2011, I consulted with three students (names deleted), five residents/fellows (names deleted) and eleven faculty members (names deleted). None of these consultations have led to co-authorship on peer-reviewed publications, but several articles are in the pipeline. I have received grant support from two of the consultations.

I received a contract from Cambridge University Press to publish a book. This would be my second book. The title is not set yet, but the book will be written for beginning researchers who are often confused about the research process and are often unsure about what to do next. It will provide guidance for the several stages of a research project: planning, data entry, data analysis, and preparing a publication.

I provided two guest lectures for the Clinical Trials class in Spring 2011. I gave an invited lecture for the Midwest Society for Pediatric Research in Iowa City in October 2010. I offered eight free one hour web seminars in June through September 2010. I am currently scheduled to lead discussion at the KUMC Statistics Journal Club on June 6, 2011.

I am a member of the CAM Statisticians group and attended the meeting for this group at the 2010 Joint Statistics Meetings in August 2010.

I wrote 27 articles for Chance News, an wiki-based summary of recent events in the news that highlight applications of statistics. I wrote 52 webpages from July 2010 through June 2011, provided annotated links to 171 external resources, and distributed seven email newsletters. I currently have 351 subscribers to this newsletter.
