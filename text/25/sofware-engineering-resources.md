I attended a great webinar by Alex Reinhart, From Code to Products - Software Engineering for Data Science. He is part of the [Delphi Group][ref-delphi-nodate] at Carnegie Mellon University, a research group working on models of infectious diseases. His last slide had additional resources, which I list below. I've only skimmed a few of these so far, but everything I've seen looks really good.
