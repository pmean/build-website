::: notes
I was browsing through Chapter 6 of the [ggplot2 book][wickham-2025] by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen, which is itself interesting reading. It explains how to display maps in ggplot2. The book, however, does not go into great detail, but rather references the Geocoding with R book. Like the ggplot2 book, this book is available for free as a website. This book goes into extensive detail and includes information about how to interface with [qgis][qgis-no-date], [saga][saga-no-date], and [grass][grass-no-date]. You can find similar books for [Python][dorman-2025] and [Julia][pronk-2025] as well.

The ggplot2 and Geocoding with R books were written using [quarto][posit-no-date] and [bookdown][xie-2016], respectively.
