You can get free statistical consulting if you work for Children's Mercy Hospital. Steve Simon and Ashley Sherman provide a wide range of statistical consulting services to help you with your research projects. This help can start as early as the **initial planning of your research**. I also help with the **analysis of your data**, using SPSS or other statistical software. We can also provide assistance with the **preparation of your presentations and publications**.

Here area some examples of the services that we have provided:

- setting up your research **hypothesis**,
- selecting and justifying your **sample size**,
- writing the **statistical methods** section for your grant,
- preparing **randomization tables** for your study,
- reviewing your **surveys** for content and quality,
- developing a system for **entering your data**,
- choosing an appropriate **statistical model** for your data,
- establishing **validity** and/or **reliability** for your measurement scales,
- checking for **violations of statistical assumptions** in your data,
- producing **graphs and tables** for your research publication, and
- providing **references** for new and unusual statistical methods.

Specific statistical advice has been outlined on a series of web pages which can be found at [my website][sim2]. The pages provide advice about planning your research, selecting an appropriate sample size, managing your research data, performing a variety of data analyses, presenting research data, and writing research papers.

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [original website][sim2].
