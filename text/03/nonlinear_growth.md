****[StATS]:** A simple model of nonlinear growth
(October 1, 2003)**

Part of the challenge in nonlinear regression is to choose the correct
form of the nonlinear relationship. Part of this is intuition, part of
this is understanding some basic mathematics, and part of it is just
trial and error.

**A very simple growth model**

The simplest model of growth uses the exponential function. If you are
trying to describe growth that eventually levels off, then the formula

![](http://www.pmean.com/images/images/03/nonlinear_growth01.gif)

is a good place to start. You can generate this formula using
differential equations that assume that the rate of growth is
proportional to the amount of growth left until full maturity.

Here's a graph of this formula.

![](http://www.pmean.com/images/images/03/nonlinear_growth02.gif)

Notice that when x equals 1, about two-thirds of the growth has
already occurred and that when x equals 3, about 95% of the growth has
occurred.

**Allowing for changes in the growth rate**

We can change the rate of growth by modifying the equation to

Here's what the graph looks like for three values of b.

Notice that a larger value of b implies faster growth. As a rough rule
of thumb, about 2/3 of the growth will occur at x=1/b and about 95% of
the growth will occur by x=3/b. For example, when b=0.5, about
two-thirds of the growth has occurred by x=2 and 95% has occurred by
x=6 (which is off the scale of this graph).

**Allowing for different starting and ending values**

We need to make two more modifications to the formula, though. First,
we need to account for a full grown size that is usually a value
different from 1. Second, we need to account for a starting size that
is usually larger than 0. These requirements modify the equation to

With this equation, the full-grown size is represented by c, and the
initial size at x=0 is represented by c-a. Here's an example of this
graph with c=0.9, a=0.7, and b=2.

You can change the values of c, a, and b to illustrate a variety of
different growth patterns. For example, here are three growth curves
that have different initial sizes, but which all reach the same full
grown size.

Here are three growth curves that start at the same initial size but
which reach different full grown sizes.

**An example using real data**

Here's some data on the growth of a child who was born prematurely.

When you ask SPSS to fit a nonlinear regression model (select ANALYZE
| REGRESSION | NONLINEAR), your dialog box will look like this:

![](http://www.pmean.com/images/images/03/nonlinear_growth10.gif)

Notice that I specified the nonlinear model as "C-A*exp(-B*age)"
and used upper case for the values C, A, and B. This makes it easier
to distinguish between these parameters and the variables.

Now you have to provide SPSS with some starting values. They don't
have to be too accurate, but they need to be in the right ball park.
Click on the PARAMETERS button to provide starting values.

If you look at the graph the we drew for the data, it looks like it
might level off around 120, so that's a good starting value for C.
The initial size is around 30. Since C-A represents the initial size,
a value of 90 would be a good starting value for A. Finally, it looks
like more than half of the growth occurs in the first 24 months. So a
good starting value for B would be 1/24, which I rounded to 0.04.

After you have added all your starting values, click on the continue
button. Here is what the dialog box looks like now.

If you want to compute predicted values and residuals, click on the
SAVE button. Otherwise, click on OK to run your nonlinear regression
model. Here is a portion of the output that SPSS produced.

Our model shows an initial size of about 30 cm, a full-grown size of
about 107 cm and a growth rate value of 0.037. Also notice how wide
the confidence intervals are for each of the parameters. This is not
too surprising, since our sample size is so small.

Be careful with this data. The full grown size represents an
extrapolation beyond the range of the data (most children continue to
grow quite a bit beyond 72 months). In fact, it looks like the
estimate of full grown size is a serious underestimate (107 cm is
about 42 inches). Perhaps this underestimate is also telling me that
my choice for a nonlinear model is not a good one.

Here is the original data (red circles) and the values predicted by
the nonlinear regression model (blue line).

There is a good level of agreement between the growth model and the
data.
