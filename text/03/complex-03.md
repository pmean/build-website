****[StATS]:** Building a complex model (April 23,
2003)**

> When you have a lot of variables that might possibly influence your
> outcome, your desire is to find some automated procedure that will
> select your model for you. **Using an automated approach is a mistake,
> because you need to use your own medical and scientific intuition to
> build the model.**
>
> You should always start by looking at each variable individually and
> see if it is related to your outcome. A graph is an excellent way to
> do this. **Graphs will help you get a feel for what variables are
> related to your outcome, how strongly they are related and if any of
> the relationships are nonlinear.** For example, does your outcome
> increase rapidly at first and then tend to level off, maybe even
> decreasing at the high end? This is an example of nonlinearity.
>
> Now you need to bring your medical and scientific background to bear.
> You know enough to make some educated guesses about these variables.
> Note carefully when the graphs are consistent with your intuition and
> when they are inconsistent. **When the graphs are inconsistent with
> your general medical and scientific understanding, think a lot about
> the situation and see what you can learn.**
>
> After you understand how each of the variables is individually related
> to your outcome, **then develop some models that look at 2 or 3 of
> these factors combined.** Use your knowledge again to make educated
> guesses about how variables might interact.
>
> Always check the more complex models against your intuition and
> against the simpler models. Are the models with two or more variables
> behaving the way you would expect based on the single variable models?
> Are they behaving in a way consistent with your intuition? **When you
> encounter surprises, think hard about the situation and see what you
> can learn.**
>
> Don\'t rely on stepwise regression or other automated procedures.
> **Stepwise regression fails to incorporate what you already understand
> (even if only imperfectly) from a medicalÂ  and scientific perspective
> and has been shown to often develop inferior models.**
