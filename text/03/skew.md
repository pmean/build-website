****[StATS]:** Skewed data (created June 5, 2003).**

*Dear Professor Mean, Please explain how the standard deviation can be
greater than the mean. I think it is because of skewed data.*

> Be careful. The most commonly used distribution is the standard
> normal. It has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. So clearly,
> it represents an example where the standard deviation is greater than
> the mean.
>
> What you are thinking about is the fairly common situation where a
> variable can only take on positive values. The concentration of ozone
> in the air is a good example of this. When the variable is
> non-negative, then usually the standard deviation is smaller than the
> mean. When it is not, it is probably because your data is skewed to
> the right (positively skewed).
>
> Clearly, the data can\'t be symmetric in such a situation. With
> symmetric data, the mean plus or minus two standard deviations would
> have to include roughly 95% of the data. But with the standard
> deviation larger than the mean, minus two standard deviations would
> put you quite a ways negative.
