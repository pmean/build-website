I'm not an expert on data mining, but I wanted to outline some of the
basic issues associated with data mining problems. This material is
based largely on notes that I took during a training class on data
mining taught by Richard De Veaux.

**What is data mining?**

There's a lot of confusing information about data mining. Sometimes, I think data mining is just an excuse for throwing around buzzwords like multilayer perceptron with sigmoidal activation functions. There are several good definitions of data mining on the web: Fayyad, Fayyad, Chaduri and Bradley, Zornes, Edelstein. Typically, data mining uses happenstance data-data that is collected for one use and then applied to another area. The emphasis is usually on prediction although sometimes it is also on understanding the relationships that produce those predictions.

**Why is there so much interest recently in data mining?**

There is a large push for data mining because the price of digital storage is so low and the power and speed of computers is so high. These problems typically have a low signal to noise ratio--there is a lot more data than there is information.

### Steps in a data mining model

A useful algorithm is [CRISP-DM][cri1] (This link is broken).

-   Define the problem;
-   Build the database;
-   Explore the data;
-   Prepare data for modeling;
-   Build the model;
-   Evaluate the model;
-   Deploy the model and results.

### Define the problem

Data mining is NOT a way to bypass an intelligent examination of the data. It is not a replacement for common sense. It does not find answers to unasked questions or to continuously monitor your database for interesting patterns.

You need to have some idea what you are looking for and why before you start the data mining model. Two common approaches to data mining are supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

### Build the database

Data mining is a team effort and you need to have a solid relationship with your IT (Information Technology) group. You should expect that 75% or more of your effort will be in data management.
