****[StATS]:** Pitch the pie! Ban the bar! (June 5,
2003)**.

*This is an outline of a speech that I gave to Bluejacket Toastmasters
on June 5, 2003.*

> *I work a lot with numbers and I\'ve found that there is usually a
> good way to display those numbers and a bad way. Here\'s an example.*
>
> ![](../01/images/pie.gif){width="184" height="69"}
>
> It\'s a pie chart with bright bold colors and a deep 3-D effect. Is
> this a good way to display the data? WRONG! You should pitch the pie.
>
> Here\'s another example.
>
> ![](../01/images/bar.gif){width="205" height="135"}
>
> It\'s a bar chart with big bold purple bars. Is this a good way to
> display the data? WRONG AGAIN! You should ban the bar.
>
> These charts are useful once in a while, but most of the time all you
> need is the numbers themselves. You don\'t have to surround them in a
> cloak of fancy colors and graphic effects. The numbers by themselves
> are often all that you need.
>
> But you can\'t just toss the numbers onto a sheet of paper and hope
> that it will work out well. You have to plan things. There are two
> things that can help:
>
> 1.  a little bit of rounding, and
> 2.  a little bit of re-ordering.

**Costs of pet ownership example**

> Shown below is a table loosely adapted from a web page on pet care.
> I\'ve taken a few liberties with some of the numbers to simplify this
> discussion, but the numbers are fairly close to the values on that web
> page.

^1^includes items like cost of the pet, initial shots, litter box,
collar, aquarium, etc.\
^2^yearly cost. This cost will vary based on the size of the pet.

> The initial cost would include the cost of the pet, litter box for a
> cat, collar and leash for a dog, aquarium for fish, and so forth.
> These are also averages and would not apply to someone who gets
> diamond studded collars for their pets. Also the average food cost for
> a small Yorkie is not going to compare the average food cost for a big
> Siberian Husky.
>
> Look at this table and tell me what patterns you see. A few patterns
> might appear
>
> -   snakes and lizards are more expensive than I would have thought.
> -   hermit crabs and rodents are fairly inexpensive.
>
> But it takes a lot of squinting and staring to discover these
> patterns.
>
> This table needs some work. The first thing is to do some rounding.

**Rounding**

> Rounding is important because it reduces the strain on your brain. You
> don\'t have to work so hard to uncover patterns in the data.
>
> When you look at a table of numbers, the first thing you often do is
> to make comparisons. These comparisons often involve an implicit
> subtraction.
>
> For example, you might wonder to yourself \"*How much difference is
> there between the average vet bills for a dog and for a cat?*\"
>
> The respective numbers are
>
> > 317.24\
> > 193.08
>
> Take some time to subtract here. This would tell you how much you
> would save on yearly vet bills if you got a cat instead of a dog.
>
> Let\'s see, four minus eight is ummm, borrow the one, ow, ow, ow, my
> brain hurts.
>
> You can simplify life by rounding the data to one or two significant
> figures. Here are the rounded costs
>
> > 320\
> > 190
>
> If I asked you to subtract those two numbers, you should be able to
> tell me the answer quickly and painlessly\--130. My wife, an avid dog
> lover, would tell you that dogs are worth every penny!
>
> When you round, you lose a little bit in precision. In this example,
> we\'re off by about six dollars or so. But the small loss in precision
> is more than made up for by the big gain in comprehension.
>
> People I work with often don\'t like to round their numbers. It took a
> lot of effort to get that 317.24, by golly, and I don\'t want to throw
> any of that away.
>
> Sometimes they will round their numbers but not enough. \"*Why can\'t
> I keep a third digit?*\" they ask. It turns out that the third digit
> will give you brain pain.
>
> There\'s a reason for this. Inside your brain is a spot for short term
> memory storage. It can usually hold about four pieces of information
> without a problem. Anything more causes an overload and slows things
> down.
>
> A pair of two digit numbers will fit into short term memory very
> easily, but a pair of three digit numbers will not.
>
> In the vet costs example, rounding to three significant figures means
> rounding to the nearest dollar rather than to the nearest ten spot.
> This leads to the following subtraction.
>
> > 317\
> > 193
>
> Ow, ow, ow, my brain hurts again.

**Re-ordering**

> When you arrange these numbers, try to anticipate the possible
> comparisons and then place the numbers close to one another. You have
> a choice here. You can orient the numbers horizontally,
>
> > 320 190
>
> by placing them within the same row. You could also orient the numbers
> vertically,
>
> > 320\
> > 190
>
> by placing them in the same column.
>
> Which orientation is best for subtracting?
>
> The vertical orientation appears far more natural for doing a
> subtraction. Also be sure to place the larger number above the smaller
> one. If you had the smaller one on top
>
> > 190\
> > 320
>
> it doesn\'t work as well.
>
> Try to sort your numbers from high to low. If you have more than one
> column of numbers, use the first column, use the last column, or use
> the average of all the columns. It doesn\'t matter too much. A few of
> your numbers might not be in perfect order, but these deviations are
> actually interesting, as you will see in the example below.
>
> Sorting by one of the columns will do a lot for your data, and if
> almost always better than the usual approach of alphabetizing by
> labels.
>
> Have you ever seen a list of numbers for each of the fifty states.
> It\'s almost always alphabetical, but most of the time this places
> states next to one another that have almost nothing in common. Alaska
> is always between Alabama and Arkansas. Wisconsin is always between
> West Virginia and Wyoming. There is nothing to recommend this
> approach.
>
> Sure you can find your own state quickly, but then can you find other
> states that are similar to your state?
>
> A better approach would be to sort the states by some criteria. List
> the states with the largest square miles at the top (Alaska, Texas,
> California) and put the states with the smallest square miles at the
> bottom (Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island).
>
> Or list the states with the most people at the top (California, Texas,
> New York) and with the fewest people at the bottom (Alaska, Vermont,
> Wyoming).

**Costs of pet ownership example, reworked**

> Here is the same table reworked. I rounded each value, and re-oriented
> the table so that the costs for each type of pet fell into the same
> column. I also sorted the numbers based on the initial cost.

> This table is a lot easier to look at. You might notice a few new
> patterns that weren\'t so obvious before.
>
> -   Birds, dogs, and cats all have about the same initial cost, but
>     cats have far smaller yearly costs.
> -   Lizards and snakes may not cost a lot at first, but they are
>     expensive to feed.
> -   Fish don\'t cost that much to buy and to feed, but have a lot of
>     miscellaneous costs, probably due to aquarium upkeep.
>
> You will probably notice other interesting patterns.

**Summary**

> If you are  displaying numbers, pitch the pie and ban the bar. Most of
> the time you are better off displaying the numbers themselves. Just be
> sure to do a little bit of rounding and re-ordering first.
