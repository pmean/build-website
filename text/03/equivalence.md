****[StATS]:**** **Steps in a typical equivalence
data analysis (November 27, 2003)**

There are three approaches that are used to demonstrate equivalence,
each with its advantages and disadvantages.

1.  Establish adequate power
2.  Report confidence intervals
3.  Perform two one-sided tests

Each of these approaches requires that you define a range of clinical
indifference first.
