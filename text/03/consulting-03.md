****[StATS]:** For CMH employees only: Statistical
Consulting Services (created 2003-04-30).**

This page is obsolete, but I am keeping it around because I am an
electronic pack rate.

You can get free statistical consulting if you work for Children\'s
Mercy Hospital. Steve Simon and Ashley Sherman provide a wide range of
statistical consulting services to help you with your research projects.
This help can start as early as the **initial planning of your
research**. I also help with the **analysis of your data**, using SPSS
or other statistical software. We can also provide assistance with the
**preparation of your presentations and publications**.

Here area some examples of the services that we have provided:

-   setting up your research **hypothesis**,
-   selecting and justifying your **sample size**,
-   writing the **statistical methods** section for your grant,
-   preparing **randomization tables** for your study,
-   reviewing your **surveys** for content and quality,
-   developing a system for **entering your data**,
-   choosing an appropriate **statistical model** for your data,
-   establishing **validity** and/or **reliability** for your
    measurement scales,
-   checking for **violations of statistical assumptions** in your data,
-   producing **graphs and tables** for your research publication, and
-   providing **references** for new and unusual statistical methods.

Specific statistical advice has been outlined on a series of web pages
which can be found at <http://www.childrensmercy.org/stats/>. The pages
provide advice about [planning your research](../08/plan.asp),
[selecting an appropriate sample
size](http://www.childrensmercy.org/stats/08/size.asp), [managing your
research data](../08/data.asp), [performing a variety of data
analyses](../08/model.asp), [presenting research
data](../category/PresentingResearchData.asp), and [writing research
papers](../category/WritingResearchPapers.asp).
