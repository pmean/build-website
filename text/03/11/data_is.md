****[StATS]:** Data is/are (created 2003-11-26)**

*Dear Professor Mean, Should I write \"data is\" or \"data are\"?*

> I\'ve always been open minded and allow people to say either. But the
> purists among us will insist that data is the plural of datum. These
> are the people who took Latin in High School while you and I were
> taking Wood Shop.
>
> If you\'re writing something that someone else will review, always use
> \"data are\". It will make the purists happy and you won\'t hear any
> criticism from the rest of us (the impurists?).
>
> I have changed the format of these web pages to use \"data are\"
> because I want the proof readers of these web pages to look for other
> things. If you do find an inappropriate use of the word \"data\"
> though, feel free to email me (my email link is at the bottom of every
> page).

> But first, a note on the word people, which means persons. This word
> is plural. It means more than one person. Since it is plural, the
> following sentence would be wrong: \"Those people is nice.\" The
> sentence is wrong because people is plural, and the verb that goes
> with people must agree in number with the noun people. The word
> \"are\" does the job, like \"Those people are nice.\"
