International Statistical Institute. Statisticians React to the News. Available in [html format](https://blog.isi-web.org/react/).

<!---More--->

+ This is a weekly blog started in July 2020 and written by a variety of prominent statisticians. The blog uses recent news reports as an opportunity to explore different issues in Statistics. The blog posts so far relate mostly to the COVID-19 crisis, which makes sense as that is the dominant news story in August 2020.
