Marisa Iati. Florida fired its coronavirus data scientist. Now she’s publishing the statistics on her own. The Washington Post. 2020-06-13. Available in [html format](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/12/rebekah-jones-florida-coronavirus/)

+ The COVID-19 crisis has caused a lot of contention over issues that normally would be ignored by everyone except a few specialists. As an example, Rebekah Jones was a data scientist for the state of Florida who was responsible for an information dashboard that displayed various statistics about COVID-19 for the state. She had a dispute with her superiors about how to display certain statistics and was fired. Since then, she has set up an independent site that analyzes Florida data.
