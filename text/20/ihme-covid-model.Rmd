I was asked to review the details of a prominent prediction model for the COVID-19 crisis. This model was developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and is commonly referred to as the IHME model. Here is a bit of background on the IHME model and some resources that discuss this model.

#### Overview of the IHME model

There is a wonderful sense of openness and transparency about research these days, and the IHME model is a good example of this.

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has been in business since 2007, so they are no Johnny-Come-Lately operation. The page that lists their staff members has well over 400 pictures. Not all of these people are working on COVID-19, I'm sure, but it appears to be a solid team effort.

The IHME is documented in several places.

This article contrasts a model based on infectious disease theory, the Imperial College model, to the IHME model and then goes on to explain some of the features of the IHME model.
