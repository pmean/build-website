Glen Wright Colopy. Philosophy of Data Science | Welcome to the Series! Youtube 2020-09-16. Available in [video format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeHEfHN39Cc).

<!---More--->

+ This is the first in a series of videos that discuss the philosophical foundations of data science, and is part of the Pod of Asclepius, an educational effort to promote better understanding of Statistics. The Philosophy of Data Science series is organized by Glen Wright Colopy, but will include many interviews with prominent data scientists. Since the lectures will be conceptual and not "how to program" lectures, you can listen to the audio portion only as a podcast and get almost all of the benefit. The notes below the Youtube video offer links to a mailing list for announcements about both the Philosophy of Data Science series and the Pod of Asclepius.
