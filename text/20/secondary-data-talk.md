I am suggesting a talk on secondary data analysis for a seminar series here at UMKC. Here is the title and abstract.

<!---More--->

"Secondary Data Analysis: Three case studies" Retrospective review of secondary data sets is a largely untapped resource for research insights. This talk will present case studies of three very different secondary data sets: a gene expression data set supplied as an appendix to a 2006 publication in Genome Research, a nationally representative hospital survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and a de-identified database of electronic health records from Kansas University Hospital. These case studies show how an interesting and easily publishable research study can be done quickly and on a small budget.
