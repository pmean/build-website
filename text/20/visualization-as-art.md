I came across an interesting article in the New York Times and two books that all have a common theme. They use the tools of data visualization to make artistic statements.

The [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/t-magazine/christine-sun-kim-artist.html), written by Anna Furman on May 21, 2019, chronicles the artistic work of Christine Sun Kim. Ms. Kim uses hand drawn pie charts to illustrate her life as a deaf person.

Near the end of the article, she mentions a book, [Data Portraits: Visualizing Black America](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JQ2LWVB/) which shows and comments on a series of hand drawn data visualization by W.E.B. DuBois that illustrate the lives of black Americans in 1900.

That page mentions another interesting book, [Dear Data](https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Data-Giorgia-Lupi/dp/1616895322/), written by Giuorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec, two artists who shared insights about their lives in a series of postcards filled with hand-drawn graphics.
