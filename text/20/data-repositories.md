This is a partial list of data repositories where you can store the datasets associated with your peer-reviewed publications. I am interested in assistance with this webpage. In particular, some of the articles and website have annotations, but others still need them. Please see the "How can I help" section.

### General overview articles

Antes AL, Walsh HA, Strait M, Hudson-Vitale CR, DuBois JM (2018). Examining Data Repository Guidelines for Qualitative Data Sharing. Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics, 13(1), 61â€“73. Available in [html format](https://doi.org/10.1177/1556264617744121) or [pdf format](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1556264617744121).

+ Qualitative data, such as data from focus groups, interviews, and open-questionnaires, presents special challenges to data sharing. This article describes these challenges but also lists the many benefits of data sharing. It then provides a list of websites that offer data sharing repositories. The authors use a rigorous approach to identifying these websites, and compares each site's guidelines using content analysis.

+ The Qualitative Data Repository is hosted by the Center for Qualitative and Multi-Method Inquiry, a unit of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. As of 2002-04-27, there were 83 datasets in this repository. You can view the metadata, but need to register to see the raw data. Users must pay a small fee to store their data in this repository, but this fee is waived for institutional sponsors.

### Acknowledgments

Here is the list where I will offer thanks to those who have helped expand this listing.

### How can I help?

If you are aware of any general overview articles about data sharing repositories, please provide a bibliographic reference. I prefer articles that are freely available on the web, but if you find a good article that is behind a paywall, that is certainly acceptable. If you can provide a brief synopsis of this article, that would be appreciated. It should be more than just a paraphrase of the abstrct, please.

If you are aware of any specific data repositories, please provide a link. Describe how the site works with details such as what type of data they are looking for and whether they require a fee before submitting any datasets.

If you can send me the information in Markdown format, that would be greatly appreciated. If you are not familiar with Markdown format, take a look at the Markdown code that was used to produce this webpage.
