I am trying to keep track of several recent initiatives at UMKC. Here are the details, as I best understand them.

<!---More--->

The School of computing and Engineering at UMKC was awarded a multi-year grant to develop research efforts in deep learning. Here is a [press release](https://info.umkc.edu/news/umkc-team-of-engineering-faculty-receive-large-grant-to-develop-center-for-big-learning/) describing the grant and listing the faculty who were awarded the grant. The grant lead to the development of the NSF IUCRC Center for Big Learning, which has a [small website](https://info.umkc.edu/NSF-CBL/) and which sponsors a semi-annual research meeting. The last meeting that I can find was held in May 2019, but the [program](https://info.umkc.edu/NSF-CBL/index.php/2019/03/14/cbl-semiannual-meeting-umkc-spring-2019/) looked like it would have been interesting to attend. I missed that meeting, but hope to attend future ones.

The NextGen Data Analytics Center (NextGen Data Science and Analytics Innovation Center) is an internally funded effort to purchase a massive computer for data analytics. Details for this project are hard to come by. A [press release](https://www.umkc.edu/news/posts/2019/august/umkc-faculty-awarded-high-priority-research-grants.html) in August 2019 talks about several grants including the one that funded this computer system. There's also a brief description [here](https://precisionhealth.umsystem.edu/research/strategic-investments.html). The grant calls for the use of a recent technology, Hyperconverged Infrastructure, that improves speed and reliability.

This computer system is a small piece of a big effort within the University of Missouri system, the NextGen Precision Health Initiative. You can find lots of press releases about this. Here's one from [January 2020](https://www.umsystem.edu/president-blog/nextgen_precision_health_initiative_update). This effort includes the construction of a [nice building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHtbLjaDDl8&feature=youtu.be) on the Columbia campus with lots of lab space. But the initiative also involves the hiring of faculty at all four campuses and lots of seed money for starting up new research projects.

Another initiative goes by the acronym IDEAS. It stands for the Institute of Data Education, Analytics, and Science. There's no official website for this group yet, but has already awarded four small seed grants to UMKC researchers and has held several [data science workshops](https://www.umkctalentlink.com/resources/?rnpid=266371) for industry partners in the Kansas City area. There's a [December 2019 press release](https://www.umkc.edu/news/posts/2019/december/meet-umkc-ideas.html) documenting how data scientist is the sexiest job of the 21st century. There are currently [four working group luncheons](https://info.umkc.edu/umatters/announcing-a-lunch-series-for-ideas-the-first-is-feb-18/) scheduled for the Spring of 2020. you might also want to look at this [two minute promotional video](https://youtu.be/9qjzjKbZoko).

There is a new initiative on research and community outreach in health, the UMKC Health Equity Institute. I attended a nice panel session decidated to the efforts of this group, which is summarized [here](https://med.umkc.edu/health-for-all-remains-an-elusive-goal/).
