+ Doug Zahn has done a tremendous amount of work on what I like to call
the human factors in statistical consulting. He summarizes some key
ideas in this article. His humorous anecdote about his prized Mustang
car illustrates the tendency of all of us to be poor listeners. Pay
special atention to Table 1 where he outlines the five steps you should
always follow in any consulting interaction. Dr. Zahn also shares a story of when he didn't listen to his nine year old son, and draws an analogy to his (and our) interactions with other researchers.
