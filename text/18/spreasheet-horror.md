There has been a lot written about data management problems with using
spreadsheets, and there is a group the European Spreadsheet Risks
Interest Group that has documented the problem carefully and thoroughly.
This page on their website lists the big, big, big problems that have
occurred because of spreadsheet mistakes. Any program is capable of
producing mistakes, of course, but spreadsheets are particularly prone
to errors for a variety of reasons that this group
documents.
