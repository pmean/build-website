I'm planning to give a talk on "The Dark Side of Data Science" and I'm hoping to get some interesting references and articles from my colleagues. Here is a first draft of my abstract with a few references that I am already familiar with.

<!---More--->

Progress in statistical modeling has grown faster than our ability to assess the individual and societal impact of these models. We can now attach numbers or labels to people that are surprisingly effective at predicting future behavior but we are in danger of losing sight of accountability and fairness in the process. In this talk, I will show examples of statistical models that have caused far more harm than good and characterize features of these models: reification lack of reproducibility implicit redlining and the inability to conduct independent audits.
