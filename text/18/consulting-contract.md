Someone asked me about what sort of contract to use with a new client.
This person did not need a very detailed contract, but said that a
handshake would not suffice. Here's what I suggested.

<!---More--->

I have never used a contract, unless the client draws one up. If you
want a contract, talk to a lawyer, and make sure it addresses the
following issues.





\- your consulting rate and payment schedule

\- the scope of work

\- who maintains copyright and/or patient rights over any material
produced

\- how liability is handled if a third party sues both you and your
client

\- how disputes over contract details should be handled

\- conditions under which either party can sever the contract

\- what terms of the contract remain in force after severance
