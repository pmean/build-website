This is a list (with single paragraph descriptions) of 186 women who
have accomplished great things in the area of Analytics. There is a
[brief accompanying
article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/2017/11/30/discover-185-outstanding-women-in-data-analytics)
at the Forbes magazine website, but it is very brief. The author of this
list, Meta S. Brown, defines Analytics quite broadly, so the women have
very diverse backgrounds and interests. I only recognized one name off
the bat, Grace Wahba, an excellent researcher, but someone,
unfortunately, that I haven't met. If I get a chance, I'll include in a
separate blog post a list of outstanding women in Analytics that I HAVE
met. Meta Brown's list includes links so you can find out more about
these talented women.
