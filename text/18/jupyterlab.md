Jupyter is an integrated development environment that uses a notebook interface. It was originally developed for Python, but is now available for a variety of other languages, including my favorite, R. I attended a talk about Jupyter from one of the main developers, and after explaining what Jupyter is, he demonstrated JupyterLab. JupyterLab is a new IDE that uses the same structure and files as Jupyter. It looks to be very simple but also very powerful.
