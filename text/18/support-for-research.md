I am drafting up a policy on statistical support for research at my
part-time job at UMKC. It is loosely based on standards at the
[University of California,
Davis](http://ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/ctsc/area/biostatistics/financialConsiderations.html)
and [Kansas University Medical
Center](http://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/department-of-biostatistics/grant-preparation.html).
An early draft appears below. I've gotten some suggestions that setting
a minimum percentage effort is a bad idea. What do you think?

**Statistical support for your research grant**

If you are considering including the support of a statistician from the
Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics on your research grant,
you're making a smart move. It not self-serving for us to point this
out; it is a conclusion that many researchers have already made on their
own.

The money you spend on statistical support will provide you with a far
greater return through improved research efficiency. Statisticians have
the tools to insure that your sample size is large enough to provide the
precision that you need, but not so large as to be wasteful. We are
aware of many alternative research designs that can, at times, provide
efficiencies large enough to allow you to reduce your sampling needs.

The money you spend on statistical support will also greatly improve
your prospects of getting funded. Reviewers expect to see a strong
research team and this includes a statistician with graduate level
training and substantial data analysis experience. You may be more than
capable of conducting your own data analysis, but without the
credentials that we already have, you will have a hard time convincing a
reviewer of your skills.

The contributions that we offer extend well beyond a sample size
justification and a data analysis plan. We have many years of experience
in providing consultation across a very broad range of science and
medicine. We know about research innovations in other fields that may be
less well known in your discipline. We have many contacts in the
research community and can help add find expertise for your research
team in areas beyond Statistics.

If you want to work with us, we need to set up some ground rules in
advance to avoid any misunderstandings.

**Planning time frame**

You cannot use our name in your grant without having us participate
fully in the development of your grant. If we haven't been active
participants in the planning, we have no way to vouch for the integrity
of the study design and data analysis plan. Generally, you need to
include us early in the development of the research grant, typically two
months or more prior to the submission date. Under no circumstances will
we consider working on a research grant if we just learn about it less
than one month from the submission date.

**Data management budget**

We will not work on any grant that does not have funding in the budget
for a data manager. A data manager is critical to guarantee data
integrity and research efficiency. We cannot do our jobs well without
this guarantee. If you do not have data management support in house, we
can provide assistance through the Center for Health Insights.

**Appropriate FTE support levels**

The normal FTE effort on a research grant is 20%, and this level needs
to be maintained throughout the duration of the research grant. You
cannot collect the data on your own and then dump it in our lap during
the last year of the grant. We must be active participants during the
data collection phase in order to do our job well.

Some grants will require more than 20% effort. These include research
studies with

-   a large number of outcome variables,
-   a longitudinal design,
-   multilevel sampling,
-   interim analyses,
-   an adaptive design,
-   an expectation of high dropout rates/many missing values.

Some studies may require less than 20% effort. Generally, these would be
studies where you conduct your own data analyses, but we provide
oversight and review. The minimum, even in these cases, is 10% effort.
The only exception to this rule is a research grant that does not ask
for any salary support for anyone on the research team.

Once we agree on a level of support appropriate for your grant, you
cannot change that level of support, even if the research methods change
markedly, without discussing this with us first.

These are not optional recommendations

The recommendations in this document are mandated for all research. If
you do not wish to abide by these recommendations on review times and
funding levels, please find your statistical support elsewhere. There
may be rare exceptions to these requirements, but these need to be
cleared first by the department chair.
