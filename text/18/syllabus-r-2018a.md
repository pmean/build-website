I am teaching a class, Introduction to R (MEDB 5505). Here is the
syllabus for Spring<U+00A0> Semester 2018.

<!---More--->

**MEDB 5505: Introduction to R**

**1. Introduction**

A working knowledge of statistical software is a vital skill for anyone
involved in quantitative research. This class will introduce data
management, simple descriptive statistics, and basic graphical display
using the R software package. Students will develop the fundamental
skills needed to prepare data sets for analysis, and to conduct simple
descriptive and graphic analyses and report those analyses.

**1.1 Course content**

This on-line course is intended to provide a working familiarity with R.
Students are not expected to have advanced programming or statistical
analysis skills. A basic understanding of statistical terminology is
necessary. The class will introduce basic methods for data import, data
management, simple graphics, and basic statistical analysis. This class
will not cover advanced statistical methods, but will provide you with a
firm foundation to address these areas in your statistics classes or in
your thesis/dissertation research.

**1.2 Student learning objectives**

At the completion of this course, students will be able to:

-   Prepare and manipulate datasets for analysis in R.
-   Conduct simple descriptive and graphic analyses of data in R.
-   Prepare a report with a summary of analyses conducted in R.

**1.3 Course framework**

This class will be taught as a self-paced, asynchronous online course.
The instructor will provide datasets and instructions for running
various functions within R. You will apply these functions to import
datasets, manipulate these datasets, and produce basic summaries of
these datasets. As the final project of the class, you will produce an
independent analysis on a dataset of your own choice that demonstrates
the techniques and skills that were covered in the course.

**2. Instructor**

Steve Simon, PhD\
Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics\
School of Medicine, M5-117

I am very grateful for the work of Karen Williams and Mary Gerkovich who
helped develop this class along with two others: MEDB 5506, Introduction
to SPSSR; and MEDB 5507, Introduction to SAS. Over time, I plan to
update the materials in this class to keep it more closely aligned with
the other two classes. These updates will be optional viewing for Fall
Semester 2017.

**2.1 Email**

My email contact information is at <http://www.pmean.com/contact.html>.
The preferred email address is the UMKC account, but any of these email
addresses are fine. I do not check email on my days off from work, so
please don't worry if you don't get an immediate response. If you have
not heard back by 48 hours, please feel free to contact me again.

**2.2 Telephone**

You are also welcome to call me. My office number is 816-235-6617 and my
cell phone number is 913-912-2076.

**2.3 Discussion forum**

Before you contact me by email or telephone, consider posting your
problem or question on the Blackboard discussion board. Others will
benefit from the exchange. You are welcome, however, to discuss problems
and ask questions via email or telephone if you prefer.

**2.4 Office hours**

You can get help for many of your questions by email, but sometimes a
face-to-face appointment is needed. I am part-time at UMKC and hold two
other part-time jobs, so I cannot hold regular office hours. I am more
than happy to meet with you face-to-face by appointment. Because of
child care responsibilities, I generally cannot meet prior to 9am (10am
on Thursdays) and I have to leave most days by 2pm. I have a lot more
flexibility for meeting via telephone.

**3. Class structure**

This class will be taught as a self-paced, asynchronous online course.
The course material is presented in five parts, with 4 assignments that
will be submitted to the instructor. In order to achieve learning
objectives, students are expected to review provided course materials,
including recorded lectures.

During the lectures, the instructor will provide examples to demonstrate
application of R. Students should open R on their own and replicate the
work shown in the video. Then students will be asked to conduct similar
work on a different dataset and turn that in as homework. Students need
to download R (as described in an early video) and optionally, RStudio.
Both R and RStudio are free.

**3.1 Student projects**

Students will be presented with either instructions on using R functions
and/or syntax files and be shown how to apply those to a provided
dataset. After replicating the work shown in the R video, students will
apply these skills to a different provided dataset. At the end of each
class section, students will turn in the produced output and a brief
written interpretation. The interpretation is very important. Output
without any interpretation will be returned. For the final project,
students will use a dataset of their own choosing, import that dataset,
manipulate it as needed, and produce a statistical report using at least
one graphical display and at least one descriptive statistical method.
This final project will include a written explanation of the results.
The dataset you work with for this final project should include at least
four variables of which two variables will be measured using continuous
data and two variables measured using categorical data.

**3.2 Grading**

This course will be graded as Pass / Fail. In order to receive a passing
grade, the student must successfully complete the four assignments, plus
the analysis of an independent data set.including the assignment for the
final day that includes work using your own data set. This work must be
completed and submitted to the instructor by the last day of the
semester, Friday, December 8, 2017, in order to get credit for the
course.

If a student feels that he/she has been unfairly graded, information on
the appeal process can be found in the academic regulations information
(<http://www.umkc.edu/catalog/Procedure_for_Appeal_of_Grades.html>).

**4. Resources**

**4.1 Textbook**

There is NO required textbook for this class. However, the following
books are possible resources you might want to purchase for your future
work with R:

-   William N. Venables, David M. Smith, and the R Core Development
    Team. An Introduction to R, Second Editon. Available in book form or
    as a free PDF file at
    <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf>.
-   Peter Dalgaard. Introductory Statistics with R.

**4.2 R software**

You should download a copy of R from <https://cran.r-project.org/>. This
is fairly easy, but you can review the steps for downloading in one of
the early videos for this class. If you have any trouble downloading R,
please contact me.

**4.3 RStudio**

RStudio is an integrated development environment for the R programming
language. Use of RStudio is encouraged, but it is not a requirement. You
can download RStudio at <https://www.rstudio.com/>. This is also fairly
easy, but you can review the steps in one of the early videos for the
class.

**4.4 Github**

Some of the files that you need will be stored at my github site,
<https://github.com/pmean>. There are several ways that you can access
these files, and this is also described in an early video. If you have
any trouble getting files stored at github, send me an email and I can
give you those files as an email attachment.

**4.5. Web Sites**

All of the material you need for this class will be availabe on
Blackboard. Here are some optional websites that you can use to
supplement your learning.

-   <http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/>. Institute for Digital Research and
    Education, UCLA. This website provides comprehensive guidance on the
    use of R (as well as other statistical software). Highly
    recommended.
-   <https://www.r-bloggers.com/>. A mash up of blog posts about R from
    750 different R bloggers. The posts are a mix of beginning,
    intermediate, and advanced levels. The quality of the posts is
    uniformly high.
-   [http://blog.pmean.com/tag/r-software/](../tag/r-software/index.html).
    My own blog, by contrast is of uneven quality. The blog covers a
    range of topics, but I tag and R related posts.

**4.6 Discussion board**

Blackboard has a discussion forum and I would encourage you to describe
any problems or post any questions to the discussion board. Other
students will benefit from seeing your question and are welcome to post
suggested solutions.

**5. Course outline**

For each part of the course, the instructor will provide a recorded
lecture that shows a demonstration of R program execution. If you are
trying to work in R at the same time as viewing the recorded lectures,
it is recommended that you use a system that will allow you to follow
along with the recordings and make notes as needed. The most effective
system is using two monitors. This can be accomplished by playing the
recording on one screen and doing other operations on the other screen.
