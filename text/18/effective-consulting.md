This article starts with a nice anecdote about being dismissive about
what someone else is saying ends up hurting you. It also provides a nice
structure, POWER, for organizing consulting meetings. POWER stands for
Prepare, Open, Work, End, and Reflect. This article was a basis for some
of the content in an [interesting webinar on
consulting](http://community.amstat.org/cas/new-item/new-item10).
