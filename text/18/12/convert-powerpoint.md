I have been constructing most of my recent presentations to R Markdown.
This includes presentations that have little or no R code in them. I
like using R Markdown because you are manipulating simple text files.
This makes it easy to use version control, among other things.

There's a new package, which I have not tried yet, that will do a direct
translation of a PowerPoint file into R Markdown. It uses a presentation
format (xaringan) that I personally do not like, but it should be pretty
easy to switch from xaringan to a different format like ioslides. The
package owner warns that you will probably have to tweak the resulting R
Markdown code to get it perfect, but the package should do "get you
about 90% of the way there for about 80% of use cases." That's still a
huge time savings.
