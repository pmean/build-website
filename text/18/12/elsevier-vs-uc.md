The University of California (UC) is in the midst of a difficult
negotiation with Reed Elsevier, a major publisher of research journals.
The dispute relates to the traditional model of publishing where the
author writes for a journal for free and the journal sells subscriptions
to individuals and libraries. A newer publication model is Open Source,
where the author pays a fee to get the article published, and then the
article is made available for free to any and all readers. The UC
library wants a large reduction in subscription fees and is threatening
to cancel the Elsevier subscription and rely solely on open source
journals. The issues are complicated and this article lays out both
sides carefully.
