I am recommending this article, not because I agree with it, but because
it reinforces a common theme: the struggle to get and keep funding is
skewing research as much as or more than conflicts caused by direct
financial support. Like many of the previous articles on the topic, I
find this article to be rife with speculation and lacking any empirical
data to support the issue. I outlined [similar
concerns](http://www.pmean.com/05/ConflictInterestA.html) on my website
back in 2005. Recently, the belief that obtaining a government grant
somehow taints your credibility has led to a [purge of good scientists
from many EPA advisory
panels](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/10/trump-s-epa-has-blocked-agency-grantees-serving-science-advisory-panels-here-what-it).

I think this article offers bad advice and bad conclusions. But please
read this article and decide for yourself.

P.S. Here's what I wrote in the comments section on this article.

I'm sorry but I can't disagree more with Dr. Carroll's commentary. The
thesis that researchers exaggerate their findings just to get more
government support for their work is an old charge and one that totally
lacks any supporting data. This is in sharp contrast to the many
empirical studies that show that industry supported research differs
markedly and in predictable ways from non-supported research. What we
have in this article is speculation, pure and simple. These speculations
may seem obvious on their face, but science frequently shows us that
what is obvious and what is true are often very different things. It's
worse than just idle conjecture, though. This article is red meat for
conservatives who want to discredit any government supported research
that exposes real environmental or occupational hazards. Shame on you,
Dr. Carroll. The next time that you talk about conflicts of interest, do
what any good scientist does. Bring some data to back up your
suppositions.
