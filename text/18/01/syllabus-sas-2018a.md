I am teaching a class, Introduction to SAS (MEDB 5507). Here is the
syllabus for Spring<U+00A0> Semester 2018.

<!---More--->

**MEDB 5507: Introduction to SAS**

**1. Introduction**

A working knowledge of statistical software is a vital skill for anyone
involved in quantitative research. This course will introduce data
management, simple descriptive statistics, and basic graphical display
using the SAS software package. Students will develop the fundamental
skills needed to prepare datasets for analysis, and to conduct simple
descriptive and graphic analyses and report those analyses.

**1.1 Course Description**

This course will to provide a working familiarity with SAS. Students are
not expected to have advanced programming or statistical analysis skills
other than the ability to create and modify text files. A basic
understanding of statistical terminology and a working familiarity with
computer-based data files (e.g., Excel) is necessary. The class will
introduce basic methods for data import, data management, simple
graphics, and basic statistical analysis. This class will not cover
advanced statistical methods, but will provide you with a firm
foundation to address these areas in your advanced statistics classes or
in your research efforts, including thesis/dissertation research.

**1.2 Student Learning Objectives**

At the completion of this course, students will be able to:

-   Prepare and manipulate datasets for analysis in SAS.
-   Conduct simple descriptive and graphic analyses of data in SAS.
-   Prepare a report with a summary of analyses conducted in SAS.

**1.3 Course Framework**

This class will be taught as a self-paced, asynchronous online course.
The instructor will provide datasets and instructions for running
various coding functions within SAS. You will apply these functions to
import datasets, manipulate these datasets, and produce basic summaries
of these datasets. As the final project of the class, you will produce
an independent analysis on a dataset of your own choice that
demonstrates the coding techniques and skills that were covered in the
course.

**2. Instructor**

Steve Simon (but thanks go to Mary M. Gerkovich who did all the heavy
lifting for this class)\
Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics\
School of Medicine, M5-117

**2.1 Email**

My email contact information is at <http://www.pmean.com/contact.html>.
The preferred email address is the UMKC account, but any of these email
addresses are fine. I do not check email on my days off from work, so
please don't worry if you don't get an immediate response. If you have
not heard back by 48 hours, please feel free to contact me again.

**2.2 Telephone**

You are also welcome to call me. My office number is 816-235-6617 and my
cell phone number is 913-912-2076.

**2.3 Discussion forum**

Before you contact me by email or telephone, consider posting your
problem or question on the Blackboard discussion board. Others will
benefit from the exchange. You are welcome, however, to discuss problems
and ask questions via email or telephone if you prefer.

**2.4 Office hours**

You can get help for many of your questions by email, but sometimes a
face-to-face appointment is needed. I am part-time at UMKC and hold two
other part-time jobs, so I cannot hold regular office hours. I am more
than happy to meet with you face-to-face by appointment. Because of
child care responsibilities, I generally cannot meet prior to 9am (10am
on Thursdays) and I have to leave most days by 2pm. I have a lot more
flexibility for meeting via telephone.

**3. Course structure**

This class is a self-paced, asynchronous online course. Course material
is organized into six parts. In order to achieve learning objectives,
students need to review provided course materials, including recorded
lectures. During the lectures, the instructor will provide coding
examples to demonstrate application of SAS, and then students will have
hands on programming experience with support and feedback from the
instructor. As the final project of the class, students will
independently apply these skills to their own dataset and produce an
analysis of these data.

**3.1 Student projects**

Students will be presented with instructions on using SAS functions
and/or syntax files and be shown how to apply those to a provided
dataset. Under the supervision of the instructor, students will apply
these skills to a different provided dataset. At the end of each part,
students will turn in material that documents their work process and
results, and a brief written interpretation of the work done for that
assignment. For the final project, students will use a new dataset of
their own choosing, import that dataset, manipulate it as needed, and
produce a statistical report using at least one graphical display and at
least one descriptive statistical method. The final project must include
a written explanation of the results. The dataset you work with for the
final project should include four or more variables of which at least
two variables are continuous measures and at least two variables are
categorical measures.

**3.2 Grading**

This course is graded as Pass / Fail. In order to receive a passing
grade, the student must successfully complete the assignments, including
the assignment for the final project that includes work using a new
dataset provided in the course or your own dataset. This work must be
completed and submitted to the instructor by Friday, April 6, 2018 in
order to get credit for the course.

**4. Resources**

**4.1 Textbook**

There is NO required textbook for this class. The following books are
possible resources you might want to purchase for your future work with
SAS.

-   Delwiche & Slaughter. The Little SAS Book. 5th Edition. SAS
    Institute Inc., Cary, NC.
-   Cody. Learning SAS by Example : A Programmer's Guide. SAS Institute
    Inc., Cary, NC.
-   Cody. SAS Statistics by Example. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC.

**4.2 SAS software**

This course will use SAS for all assignments and the final project.
Students will have access to the SAS program either directly on a
computer that has SAS installed, through UMKC Remote Labs
(http://www.umkc.edu/is/remotelabs/), or through SAS resources (refer
below to SAS University under Other Resources). The Department of
Biomedical and Health Informatics has student computer workstations
available that can be used by arrangement.

Please note that when you are logged onto Remote Labs, it will probably
be difficult to have direct access to a drive (USB or hard drive) on the
computer you are sitting at (the remote system has a hard time seeing
these local devices/ports). You will, however, be able to save files to
your Q drive space. When using the UMKC Remote Labs resource, I
recommend that you save your course files on your Q drive space or use
cloud storage. The Q drive space is part of the UMKC network and your
space is automatically mapped when you log onto the UMKC system. If you
have questions about how to access this directory, contact UMKC
Information Services (816-235-2000). From the Q drive, files can be
copied/moved to other storage locations/devices.

**4.2 SAS University**

SAS offers a product, SAS University, that is free to anyone as long as
it is not used for commercial purposes. Details are available at
[http://blog.pmean.com/sas-university/](../sas-university/index.html).

4.3 Web Sites (compiled with the help of Dr. Jenifer Allsworth & Michel
Conn)

SAS tutorials. SAS offers many online tutorials -- view the complete
listing at <http://support.sas.com/training/tutorial/>. The SAS basic
programming online tutorial is free:
<https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?ctry=us&id=2588>.

SAS Analytics U. This is a Youtube channel that includes videos on many
topics:
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVBcK_IpFVi9cajJtRel2uBLbtcLz-WIN>.

UCLA has a fantastic website with lots of resources for SAS users (as
well as R, SPSS, and Stata users). The main site is at
<http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/> and the SAS Starter Kit is at
<http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/sk/default.htm>.

This paper by a SAS user has a comprehensive listing of websites with
training materials and coding tips:
<http://analytics.ncsu.edu/sesug/2003/TD02-Stojanovic.pdf>.

**5. Course outline**

For each part of the course, the instructor will provide a recorded
lecture that shows a demonstration of SAS coding and program execution.
In addition, in the Course Content area of the course Blackboard site
students will have a Course Outline document (MEDB 5507\_Intro to
SAS\_Course Outline\_Notes & Assignments\_FS2017.pdf) that provides
detailed notes and information on each assignment. Also loaded in the
Course Content area will be data files that are not publicly available,
descriptions of these data files, and the SAS program files used for the
recorded coding examples. These coding files can be used as the starting
point for your own coding if desired; they can be edited using the SAS
program editor, or edited using a text editor and copied into the SAS
program editor. It is recomended that you copy these files to a local
device (i.e., hard drive or USB drive) to simplify working with the
information.

If you are trying to work in SAS at the same time as viewing the
recorded lectures, it is recommended that you use a system that will
allow you to follow along with the recordings and make notes on the
coding as needed. If you are using a system that has 2 monitors, this
can be accomplished by playing the recording on one screen and doing
other operations on the other screen.

A Discussion Board area (Discussion Forum, Intro to SAS -- Questions &
Answers) is established in the course Blackboard site in order to have a
space for questions and answers that will be available to all students.
To post a question on this forum,

Note -- if you are getting a SAS error message you don't understand, you
can copy the error message into the Description box. If you want a
section of coding reviewed because you are having a problem with it, you
can also copy the text into the Description box.<U+00A0> The instructor will
review and respond to items posted on the Discussion Board on a regular
basis. If you have not gotten a response within a day or two, send an
email to the instructor asking her to review your question in the
discussion forum.
