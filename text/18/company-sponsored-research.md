Very little of my research fits into the category of company-sponsored
medical research, but it is important to be aware of the special
concerns and the extra oversight that this research requires. This
article cover a consensus standard of guidelines that make a lot of
sense, in my opinion, to avoid some of the recent controversies about
research abuses. It is also a pretty good guideline, for the most part,
for other medical research beyond company-sponsored
research.
