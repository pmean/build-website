I have been constructing most of my recent presentations to R Markdown. This includes presentations that have little or no R code in them. I like using R Markdown because you are manipulating simple text files. This makes it easy to use version control, among other things.

There's a new package, which I have not tried yet, that will do a direct translation of a PowerPoint file into R Markdown. It uses a presentation format (xaringan) that I personally do not like, but it should be pretty easy to switch from xaringan to a different format like ioslides. The package owner warns that you will probably have to tweak the resulting R Markdown code to get it perfect, but the package should do "get you about 90% of the way there for about 80% of use cases." That's still a huge time savings.
