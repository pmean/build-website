There's an interesting visualization system called d3, that I only
became aware of a few months ago. It uses a fairly minimal system,
javascript and support vector graphics, but is capable of producing
[tremendously rich graphics](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/gallery).
I've tried, when I have a few spare moments, to learn d3. It's not that
complicated, but I am hindered by a lack of knowledge about javascript.
It's also difficult to debug a d3 program. There's a new library in R
that should make things a bit easier for someone like me. It's called
r2d3 and is being promoted with the new [preview release of
RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).
