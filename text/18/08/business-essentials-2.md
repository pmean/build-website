I'm giving a talk on Wednesday, August 22, titled "Business essentials
for starting an independent consulting practice." Here are a few details
about this talk.

<!---More--->

It is being sponsored by the Statistical Consulting Section of the
American Statistical Association (ASA). You can register for it, if you
hurry, at <http://www.amstat.org/ASA/Education/Web-Based-Lectures.aspx>.
There is a fee for this webinar (\$85) with a discount for ASA members
and a further discount for ASA members who belong to the Statistical
Consulting Section. Here's the abstract for the talk:

"If you want to set up your own consulting business, you need to learn a
few basic business skills. You need to set up an independent financial
system for income and expenses. You need to decide between a sole
proprietorship, a limited liability corporation, or an S/C Corporation.
You need a system for invoicing. You need to examine insurance options.
This webinar will explain why each of these is important. Disclaimer: I
am not a lawyer, an accountant, or an insurance agent. Furthermore,
there are no "one size fits all" solutions. This webinar will help you
know what your options are, but you should discuss your particular
situation with a qualified lawyer and accountant to choose what is best
for you."

I am working on the slides for this talk and will post them here when I
have completed them.
