At first glance, you might think that this article looks like a
vindication of traditional statistics. Classical time series models
(methods that were available in the 1960's) outperform newer machine
language forecasting models. Then, you might worry that the comparisons
were unfair. But neither viewpoint is accurate. The classical time
series models have certain structural advantages for certain types of
problems, but you might be better off with machine learning if you use
classical time series as a preprocessing step, such as de-seasonalizing
your data. If nothing else, this article provides a nice overview of
some of the major machine learning methods.
