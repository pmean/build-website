I'm ginvg a talk about i2b2 (among other things) and when browsing
through their website, I cam across an interesting project, SHRINE. This
is an acronym for Shared health Research Informatics NEtwork., and
represents a way of allowing users to review information across multiple
i2b2 sites. It requires the individual institutions who have i2b2
systems to cooperate with one another, which is not always easy. But
this has tremendous potential.
