I generally shy away from Philosophical debates, but I did discuss a
[Postmodern critique of Evidence Based
Medicine](http://www.pmean.com/07/PostModernAssault.html) a while back.
When one of my more intellectual friends posted a link to a commentary
on Postmodernism on the Existential Comics web site, I had to take a
look. I think I did a pretty good job of summarizing Postmodernism
without stereotyping it, but maybe I'm setting my standards too low if I
try to compete with a comic strip. You can judge for
yourself.
