I've been using [a version of LaTeX (MikTeX)](https://miktex.org/) for a
couple of years, and it's not bad. But when I heard about Yihui Xie's R
package, tinytex, I jumped at the opportunity to try it. Dr. Xie is the
author of [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/), a package that makes it
easy to create well documented R programs where the code and the output
are gracefully merged. He created this new package, tinytex, because he
felt that the current versions of LaTex had complex installation
processes and forced you to choose between a minimal installation that
couldn't do anything useful and a full installation that was bloated
with features you'd never use. I can't say too much about the package
yet except that he is right in that it is very easy to install. If I
find out more, I'll let you know.
