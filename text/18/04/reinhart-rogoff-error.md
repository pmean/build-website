There has been a lot written about how lousy Microsoft Excel (and other
spreadsheet products) are at data management, but the warning sinks in
so much more effectively when you can cite an example where the use of
Excel leads to an embarrassing retraction. Perhaps the best example is
the paper by Carmen Reinhart and Peter Rogoff where a major conclusion
was invalidated when a formula inside their Excel spreadsheet
accidentally included only 15 of the relevant 20 countries. Here's a
nice description of that event and some suggestions on how to avoid this
in the future.
