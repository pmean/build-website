I'm planning to give a talk on "The Dark Side of Data Science" and I'm
hoping to get some interesting references and articles from my
colleagues. Here is a first draft of my abstract
- with a few references
that I am already familiar with.

<!---More--->

Progress in statistical modeling has grown faster than our ability to
assess the individual and societal impact of these models. We can now
attach numbers or labels to people that are surprisingly effective at
predicting future behavior
- but we are in danger of losing sight of
accountability and fairness in the process. In this talk
- I will show
examples of statistical models that have caused far more harm than good
and characterize features of these models: reification
- lack of
reproducibility
- implicit redlining
- and the inability to conduct
independent audits.
