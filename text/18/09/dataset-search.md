I heard about this from the [UMKC Bioinformatics twitter
feed](https://twitter.com/umkcbiomed?lang=en). Google has a blog entry
highlighting a new search feature they've developed, Dataset Search. It
lets you find interesting data sets using standard Google search
criteria. The system only works if people on the web provide reasonable
documentation of their data sets. I've not had a chance to work with
this yet, but it looks interesting.
