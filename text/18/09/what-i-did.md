For the yearly evaluation for my part-time position in the Department of
Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Missouri-Kansas
City, I have had to prepare a list of accomplisments and goals for the
upcoming year. I thought that I'd share this year's list on my
blog.

<!---More--->

**Accomplishments**: I prepared two articles for the Encyclopedia of Big
Data, Springer (in press). The first is a summary of the large
nationally representative surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. The second is a summary of big data sources and
geographic information at the Bureau of the Census.

I gave two big presentations. The first was an invited talk at the 2017
Applied Stochastic Modeling and Data Analysis conference in London,
England, "Simulation before, during, and after a clinical trial: A
Bayesian approach." The second was a contributed talk at the 2018 Cerner
Statistics conference, "Mining the Electronic Health Record. Why and
How."

My work ended on the PCORI research grant, The Greater Plains
Collaborative, but this work carried over onto the CTSA grant,
Frontiers, University of Kansas Clinical and Translational Science
Institute. I am supported at 11% effort on this grant with the goal of
encouraging more utilization of research using the electronic health
record at academic institutions and hospitals in the Kansas City region.

I carried an overload of classes (at least relative to a 25% faculty
appointment), teaching two sections of MEDB5505, Introduction to R, a
section of MEDB 5506, Introduction to SPSS, and a section of MEDB 5507,
Introduction to SAS. I am also co-developing a new course, Introduction
to SQL, with another member of our department. I took and passed the
Faculty Online Certification class and attended two FaCET conferences.

I helped with the planning of a big data/data science initiative at
UMKC, and helped introduce medical students to the analysis of Health
Facts data sets. I provided informal guidance to three PhD students
working at the Center for Economic Information and one PhD student in
the Department of Psychology. I gave a talk on writing research grants
for the UMKC Writing Studio.

**Goals**: My goals for the upcoming year are to complete work on the
Introduction to SQL class, adapt the online classes MEDB 5505, 5506, and
5507 to meet ADA requirements, and submit a research grant to study
Bayesian simulation of clinical trials.
