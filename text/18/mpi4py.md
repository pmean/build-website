The [Python Software Foundation][pys1] supports [PyPA][pyp1], the Python Packaging Authority, a group that maintains an easy to use infrastructure for distributing Python software packages. I've used one of their sites, [PyPI][pyp2], to download mpi4py, a way to run Message Passing Interface applications within Python.

Python Software Foundation. mpi4py 3.0.0. Available in [html format][mpi1].

You can find an [earlier version][sim1] of this page on my [blog][sim2].
