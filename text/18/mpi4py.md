The [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) supports
[PyPA](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/), the Python Packaging Authority,
a group that maintains an easy to use infrastructure for distributing
Python software packages. I've used one of their sites,
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/), to download mpi4py, a way to run Message
Passing Interface applications within Python.
