I've been using [a version of LaTeX (MikTeX)](https://miktex.org/) for a
couple of years
- and it's not bad. But when I heard about Yihui Xie's R
package
- tinytex
- I jumped at the opportunity to try it. Dr. Xie is the
author of [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/)
- a package that makes it
easy to create well documented R programs where the code and the output
are gracefully merged. He created this new package
- tinytex
- because he
felt that the current versions of LaTex had complex installation
processes and forced you to choose between a minimal installation that
couldn't do anything useful and a full installation that was bloated
with features you'd never use. I can't say too much about the package
yet except that he is right in that it is very easy to install. If I
find out more
- I'll let you know.
