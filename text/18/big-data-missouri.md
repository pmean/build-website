I was at a meeting where I learned about some recent efforts with big
data at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the University of
Missouri/Columbia. Here's a brief description along with
links.

<!---More--->

[Center for Economic Information (UMKC)](http://cei.umkc.edu/). This
group was formed in 1994 with a mission to "use information technology
in support of economic decision-makers in the public and private
sectors, and academic researchers."

[Center for Big Data (UMKC)](https://info.umkc.edu/NSF-CBL/). This group
also goes by the acronym I/UCRC (Industry/University Collaborative
Research Center). This is one of four NSF funded sites throughout the
U.S. funded to "accelerate innovation and impact of Deep Learning in
various embedded applications."

[Translational Precision Medicine Complex
(UM)](https://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2018/0504-mu-seeks-proposals-to-manage-development-implementation-of-translational-precision-medicine-complex/).
This effort is just getting started. The link is to a press release and
emphasizes "a collaborative approach to disease treatment and prevention
that accounts for individual variability in genes, environment and
lifestyle."
