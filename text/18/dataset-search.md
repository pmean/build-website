I heard about this from the [UMKC Bioinformatics twitter feed][umk1]. Google has a blog entry highlighting a new search feature they've developed, Dataset Search. It lets you find interesting data sets using standard Google search criteria. The system only works if people on the web provide reasonable documentation of their data sets. I've not had a chance to work with this yet, but it looks interesting.
