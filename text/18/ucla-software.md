I'm teaching an online workshop for [The Analysis
Factor](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/) on survival analysis. It's
not announced yet
- and I have a LOT of work to do before it is ready.
One thing that will save me time is that I am taking many of my examples
from the excellent textbook
- Applied Survival Analysis Second Edition.
One nice perk of this book is that the helpful folks at UCLA have taken
every textbook example
- and written up code (with comments!) to
reproduce the book's results. With the exception of a few advanced
methods in later chapters
- where only one or two software packages have
the right capability
- the code is written in parallel in R
- SAS
- SPSS,
and Stata. They also have links to the [raw data at the publishers
website](ftp://ftp.wiley.com/public/sci_tech_med/survival/)
- and
datasets stored in [SAS
format](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/asa2_sas.zip)
and [SPSS
format](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/asa2_spss.zip).
How nice! Browse around and you'll find software code for all the
examples in other popular statistics textbooks as well.

Warning! The R examples look like they are from the first edition
- not
the second edition. A small nitpick for an otherwise very nice
resource.
