I'm teaching an online workshop for [The Analysis
Factor](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/) on survival analysis. It's
not announced yet, and I have a LOT of work to do before it is ready.
One thing that will save me time is that I am taking many of my examples
from the excellent textbook, Applied Survival Analysis Second Edition.
One nice perk of this book is that the helpful folks at UCLA have taken
every textbook example, and written up code (with comments!) to
reproduce the book's results. With the exception of a few advanced
methods in later chapters, where only one or two software packages have
the right capability, the code is written in parallel in R, SAS, SPSS,
and Stata. They also have links to the [raw data at the publishers
website](ftp://ftp.wiley.com/public/sci_tech_med/survival/), and
datasets stored in [SAS
format](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/asa2_sas.zip)
and [SPSS
format](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/asa2_spss.zip).
How nice! Browse around and you'll find software code for all the
examples in other popular statistics textbooks as well.

Warning! The R examples look like they are from the first edition, not
the second edition. A small nitpick for an otherwise very nice
resource.
