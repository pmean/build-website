I was at a talk where mortality rates were presented in one column and<U+00A0>
the standardized mortality ratio was presented in a different column. I
was a bit confused; I could not remember how or why you calculate an
SMR. It's not because SMR calculations are complicated; it's because my
brain can't remember things as well as it used to. So when I got back to
my office, I searched for a web site with a simple tutorial on SMRs with
a worked out example. This page popped up right away and I was impressed
with the clarity of the writing style.
