I don't call myself a "big data" analyst
- but when a call went out
seeking authors for various topics for the Encyclopedia of Big Data
- I
volunteered to write two articles. Here are the details.

<!---More--->

The first article I wrote was about the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). I used to work at CDC. To be fair
- I did not work on
any of the things that I wrote about in the encyclopedia entry
- but I
did know some of the people who did work on those big data systems. I
have also used many CDC data sets in my research at Children's Mercy
Hospital.

When I completed my article
- I noticed that no one had volunteered yet
to write an article about the U.S. Census Bureau. This was a big
omission
- in my opinion
- so I volunteered to write that article also.
There are probably others who could have written a much better article
about the Census Bureau
- but if they weren't volunteering
- then better
me than no one.

The citations for my two articles are

Simon S.D. (2018) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In:
Schintler L.
- McNeely C. (eds) Encyclopedia of Big Data. Springer
- Cham

Simon S.D. (2018) Census Bureau (U.S.). In: Schintler L.
- McNeely C.
(eds) Encyclopedia of Big Data. Springer
- Cham

These articles are probably behind a pay wall
- but I don't have enough
leverage to ask for open source publication of my work. I may be able to
self-archive this work
- but I have to investigate my options carefully.
The [licensing terms for
authors](https://www.nature.com/authors/policies/license.html) are quite
detailed.
