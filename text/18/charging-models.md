I was talking about pricing models for consulting in an email exchange
and I thought I'd extract some of those comments for this blog. When you
are an independent consultant, you need to decide whether you will
charge by the hour or charge a flat fee for the entire
project.

I normally charge by the hour, and it makes sense for many of the people
that I work with. A lot of the work is providing answers as needed to
guide someone through the process of getting a dissertation completed.
The model works best when neither you nor your client have a good idea
of what is specifically needed. It also works well when you can produce
something of concrete value on a regular and on-going basis.

Consulting by the hour does not make sense when the projects are big and
you are producing a single product at the end of the contract. Your
client starts to worry when the hourly bills keep adding up and they
start to worry that maybe they are throwing their money down a black
hole.

As a consultant, you should always work to show visible signs of
progress throughout the duration of your contract, but this is easier
for some projects than for others.

Even though I have not used a fixed price model for my consulting it has
a lot of advantages. It gets your client to think in terms of the value
that you provide. It also avoids an embarassing comparison to lawyers
and accountants, who also usually charge an hourly rate. I make more
than the typical lawyer or accountant, and I don't apologize for it, but
it does lead to sticker shock.

The key to a fixed price model is getting a detailed scope of work
defined. Your client may or may not be able to give you a detailed scope
of work, but you do have the option of charging a certain fee to help
them produce a detailed scope of work. Once that is done, you can offer
a price for the contract, and if your client thinks it is too much, then
you're sad at what you missed out on, but you do have compensation for
the time that you spent.

A detailed scope of work provides protection for both you and your
client. If you are working as a consultant, you want to avoid mission
creep, the adding of "just one more thing" that ends up piling up more
and more time on a project that you thought you could finish in a week
and now it's streatching out over several months.

A detailed scope of work protects your client, as well. By spelling out
in detail what your client needs, They get the assurance that you won't
cut any corners.

If you charge by the project, be sure to ask for some of the money up
front, before you start your work and more of the money as you reach one
or more mid-project milestones.
