Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms that are used for crime
detection, loan approvals, and employee evaluations are considered by
many to be objective, but they can sometimes have many of the same
prejudices and biases that human evaluators have. Given the opacity of
many black box approaches to AI, this could lead to serious problems
with fairness and equity. This article discusses an admittedly imperfect
approach by Microsoft to evaluate these AI algorithms using (surprise!)
an AI algorithm. It flags situations where an algorithm appears to have
problems with unfair differential treatments<U+00A0> based on race, gender, or
age.
