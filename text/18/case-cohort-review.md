I got a question about how to analyze a case cohort study in Stata. The person was following the code in a [Stata conference presentation][nor1] but was unsure about some of the details. Always looking for simple explanations that I myself don't understand well, I found this nice article on how these case cohort studies are written up in the literature. Naturally, it provides a brief explanation of how you analyze data from a case cohort design along with several helpful references.
