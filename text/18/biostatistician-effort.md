What percentage effort is reasonable for Biostatistics support on a
research grant? The UC Davis Biostatistics Group says 10% as a bare
minimum, 35-60% for straightforward projects with uncomplicated
analyses, and 50-100%+ for large or complex projects. They give examples
of large and complex projects: interim analysis, multi-site projects,
development of novel statistical methods, and assembly of data from
large, complex, or poorly documented administrative or survey data sets.

They also describe how to split the effort between a PhD
Biostatistician, who supervises the overall effort, and a MS
Biostatistician, who does most of the data management and statistical
analysis.

Another point worth noting is that any grant listing less than 10%
effort for a Biostatistician requires a special sign off.
