I'm giving a talk on Wednesday, August 22, titled "Business essentials for starting an independent consulting practice." Here are a few details about this talk.

<!---More--->

It is being sponsored by the Statistical Consulting Section of the American Statistical Association (ASA). Here's the abstract for the talk:

"If you want to set up your own consulting business, you need to learn a few basic business skills. You need to set up an independent financial system for income and expenses. You need to decide between a sole proprietorship, a limited liability corporation, or an S/C Corporation. You need a system for invoicing. You need to examine insurance options. This webinar will explain why each of these is important. Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, an accountant, or an insurance agent. Furthermore, there are no "one size fits all" solutions. This webinar will help you know what your options are, but you should discuss your particular situation with a qualified lawyer and accountant to choose what is best for you."

I am working on the slides for this talk and will post them here when I have completed them.
