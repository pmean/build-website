I don't use SAS that much anymore. Not because it's a bad program.
Mostly it's because it's hard to keep on top of too many statistical
packages all at once. But I'm teaching an Introduction to SAS class this
semester, and I need to keep up with recent innovations. One of the more
important of these is ODS, which is short for Output Delivery System.
ODS allows you to customize the output using formats like HTML, RTF,
PDF, or PostScript. ODS also produces PowerPoint and Excel files.

ODS also allows you to customize how your output appears. Finally, ODS
makes some big changes to procedures that used to only produce printed
output. With ODS enabled, these procedures will add in extra high
resolution plots, which you can also customize.

I do not know if the Introduction to SAS class should incorporate ODS or
not. It's similar to asking if the Introduction to R class should
incorporate markdown documents or not. In general, I tend to think that
we should teach plain vanilla versions of SAS and R, but I do worry that
we may be missing something important if we don't teach ODS or
markdown.
