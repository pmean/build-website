I don't call myself a "big data" analyst, but when a call went out
seeking authors for various topics for the Encyclopedia of Big Data, I
volunteered to write two articles. Here are the details.

<!---More--->

The first article I wrote was about the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). I used to work at CDC. To be fair, I did not work on
any of the things that I wrote about in the encyclopedia entry, but I
did know some of the people who did work on those big data systems. I
have also used many CDC data sets in my research at Children's Mercy
Hospital.

When I completed my article, I noticed that no one had volunteered yet
to write an article about the U.S. Census Bureau. This was a big
omission, in my opinion, so I volunteered to write that article also.
There are probably others who could have written a much better article
about the Census Bureau, but if they weren't volunteering, then better
me than no one.

The citations for my two articles are

Simon S.D. (2018) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In:
Schintler L., McNeely C. (eds) Encyclopedia of Big Data. Springer, Cham

Simon S.D. (2018) Census Bureau (U.S.). In: Schintler L., McNeely C.
(eds) Encyclopedia of Big Data. Springer, Cham

These articles are probably behind a pay wall, but I don't have enough
leverage to ask for open source publication of my work. I may be able to
self-archive this work, but I have to investigate my options carefully.
The [licensing terms for
authors](https://www.nature.com/authors/policies/license.html) are quite
detailed.
