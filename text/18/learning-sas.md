I had three students who successfully completed the Introduction to SAS
class that I am teaching at UMKC. Here is the advice that I offered
about how to continue to learn more about SAS.

<!---More--->

SAS Institute has an excellent support network and all of their
documentation is online, so I would certainly encourage you to check
their material. SAS Publications offers numerous books that are all
carefully vetted and written by nationally recognized experts. The
prices on SAS publications are fairly reasonable. SAS also maintains
various peer support communities.

SAS hosts many conferences and the regional conference (Midwest SAS
Users Group) usually is held at a location not too far from Kansas City.
There used to be a Kansas City Area SAS Users Group with quarterly
meetings, but I could not find any recent information about this group
on the web.

There is a SAS training center in Overland Park. The courses are not
cheap but are worth the money.

SAS Institute offers various certification programs. These also cost
money, but provide you with a credential that may help you get a better
job.

There's not a lot of resources outside of SAS that help. The one major
exception is the [UCLA Institute for Digital Research and
Education](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/sas/). This site has lots of
resources not just for SAS, but for SPSS, Stata, and R. I can't say
enough good things about this site.

The one big thing about SAS is that most of the resources cost money.
The three exceptions are the online documentation manuals, the peer
support communities, and the UCLA site. Pretty much everything else
costs money. The prices are not bad, but you have to decide on your own
whether the benefits outweigh the price.
