Some of my students in my Introduction to SAS class are having trouble
with a particular data set. Here are some screen shots showing how SAS
can read this file in several different ways.

There are four videos that you can listen to instead of reading this
handout.

Here is what SAS looks like when you fire it up.

![What the SAS screen looks like when you first open
it](http://www.pmean.com/18/images/backpain01/01-sas-screen-at-opening.png)

The default arrangement is atrocious in my opinion. There may be a way
to change this, but I don't know how.

![SAS screen with a blank editor
window](http://www.pmean.com/18/images/backpain01/02-sas-screen-blank-editor-window.png)

Here, I've ditched the useless left panel and maximized the EDITOR
window. Load the SAS program backpain\_import.sas.

    libname MEDB5507
      "c:/Users/simons/Dropbox/u/DBHI/classes/2018a_sas/dat";
    filename backpain
      "c:/Users/simons/Dropbox/u/DBHI/classes/2018a_sas/dat/backpain.txt";
    data MEDB5507.backpain_v01 replace;
      infile backpain delimiter='09'x firstobs=2 ;
      input
        Subject
        Group $
        Match
        Age
        Height
        Weight
        Event $
        Years /* also try Years $ */
        WeekDist
        Dominant $
        DF_Iliopsoas
        DF_Rectus
        DF_ITBTFL
        DF_Hamstring
        DL_Iliopsoas
        DL_Rectus
        DL_ITBTFL
        DL_Hamstring
        NF_Iliopsoas
        NF_Rectus
        NF_ITBTFL
        NF_Hamstring
        NL_Iliopsoas
        NL_Rectus
        NL_ITBTFL
        NL_Hamstring
    ;
    run;
    proc print
        data=MEDB5507.backpain_v01;
      var Subject Group Years;
      title "Printout of first import attempt";
    run;

Let's take this apart, line by line.

    libname MEDB5507
      "c:/Users/simons/Dropbox/u/DBHI/classes/2018a_sas/dat";

The LIBNAME statement takes the long and ugly path where I store my
files and assigns it the nickname "MEDB5507<U+2033>. Your LIBNAME statement, of
course, will look different, and you may prefer a different nickname.

    filename backpain
      "c:/Users/simons/Dropbox/u/DBHI/classes/2018a_sas/dat/backpain.txt";

The FILENAME statement takes the full path and filename for the location
of the file we want to use repeatedly and assigns it the nickname
backpain.

    data MEDB5507.backpain_v01 replace;
      infile backpain delimiter='09'x firstobs=2 ;

The DATA statement has a two part name. The part before the dot tells
SAS to use the folder associated with the nickname MEDB5507. The part
after the dot gives the name of the file.

The REPLACE option tells SAS that if it encounters an existing file with
the same name, it's okay to overwrite it with the new file.

      infile backpain delimiter='09'x firstobs=2 ;

The INFILE statement tells SAS where to find the input. Using the
backpain nickname that we created earlier with the FILENAME statement
shortens our code a bit, You could have used LIBNAME
"C:/YOUR\_VERY\_LONG\_PATH/FILENAME.TXT" and that would have worked
also.

The DELIMITER option tells SAS that this is a tab delimited file. 09 is
hexadecimal for the tab character. Knowing what delimiter to use is part
of the challenge of reading in text data.

The FIRSTOBS option tells SAS to start on the second row and ignore what
appears on the first row.

![Website list of backpain
data](http://www.pmean.com/18/images/backpain01/10-website-listing-of-backpain-data.png)

Here's what the file looks like, if you don't remember. This listing is
a bit difficult to read because of the line wrapping.

![Website list of backpain data, lower
half](http://www.pmean.com/18/images/backpain01/11-website-listing-of-backpain-data-lower-half.png)

Scroll down to the bottom and you'll notice a handful of NA values.
These are missing value codes using the R convention, and not the SAS
convention. We'll find out in just a minute that these NA values are the
cause of all our indigestion.

      input
        Subject
        Group $
        Match
        Age
        Height
        Weight
        Event $
        Years /* also try Years $ */
        WeekDist
        Dominant $
        DF_Iliopsoas
        DF_Rectus
        DF_ITBTFL
        DF_Hamstring
        DL_Iliopsoas
        DL_Rectus
        DL_ITBTFL
        DL_Hamstring
        NF_Iliopsoas
        NF_Rectus
        NF_ITBTFL
        NF_Hamstring
        NL_Iliopsoas
        NL_Rectus
        NL_ITBTFL
        NL_Hamstring
    ;

Back to the code, when you are reading in data using this approach, you
have to list the variable names. This is a big difference between this
approach and PROC IMPORT (which we will see later). PROC IMPORT can get
your variable names from the first line of the file.

For any alphanumeric data, such as the Group variable, you have to warn
SAS by placing a dollar sign after the variable.

Years is a numeric variable, or at least that's what SAS thinks. We'll
come back to this later and warn SAS that Years is not numeric to get
quite different results.

    proc print
        data=MEDB5507.backpain_v01;
      var Subject Group Years;
      title "Printout of first import attempt";
    run;

I always like to print all of my data after reading it in, but to make
things easier, I will only print three of the variables: Subject, Group,
and Years.

![LOG window after running the first
part](http://www.pmean.com/18/images/backpain01/16-log-window.png)

If you run the first part of the program, this is what you log window
looks like. Please note that SAS will put you at the bottom of the log
file, but you should always start at the very top when reviewing the log
window.

Page down to see the Invalid data note.

     NOTE: Invalid data for Years in line 24 31-32.
     RULE:     ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7----+----8----+----9----+----0

     NF_ITBTFL=-8 NF_Hamstring=56 NL_Iliopsoas=28 NL_Rectus=32 NL_ITBTFL=24 NL_Hamstring=104 _ERROR_=1 _N_=23

It occurs on the 24th line of data, the first line with the R code of NA
for missing. There are several more of these.

![OUTPUT window after the running the first
part](http://www.pmean.com/18/images/backpain01/18-output-window.png)

These INVALID DATA notes did not prevent your program from running. The
output from PROC PRINT looks very nice.

![OUTPUT window, bottom
half](http://www.pmean.com/18/images/backpain01/19-output-window-bottom-half.png)

Scroll down to the very bottom and notice that the 23rd subject and all
the later subjects have had their NA values converted to a dot, the SAS
code for a missing value.

You can avoid all those irritating "Invalid data" messages fairly
easily.

    data MEDB5507.backpain_v02 replace;
      infile backpain delimiter='09'x firstobs=2 ;
      input
        Subject
        Group $
        Match
        Age
        Height
        Weight
        Event $
        Years $ 
        WeekDist
        Dominant $
        DF_Iliopsoas
        DF_Rectus
        DF_ITBTFL
        DF_Hamstring
        DL_Iliopsoas
        DL_Rectus
        DL_ITBTFL
        DL_Hamstring
        NF_Iliopsoas
        NF_Rectus
        NF_ITBTFL
        NF_Hamstring
        NL_Iliopsoas
        NL_Rectus
        NL_ITBTFL
        NL_Hamstring
      ;
      if (Years="NA") then Years=".";
      Years_num=input(Years, 3.0);
    run;
    proc print
        data=MEDB5507.backpain_v02;
      var Subject Group Years Years_num;
      title "Printout of second import";

Notice the very small change in the input statement.

        Years $

Since Years is a mixture of numbers and NA codes, you can read it in as
alphanumeric. That will avoid the Invalid data messages.

      if (Years="NA") then Years=".";

Then convert the missing code in R (NA) to the missing code in SAS (.).

      Years_num=input(Years, 3.0);

Then use the input function to convert to numeric. The second argument,
3.0, means up to 3 digits with no decimal places.

Now let's see what happens when you try to read in the data set using
PROC IMPORT.

    proc import
     datafile=backpain
     dbms=dlm
     out=MEDB5507.backpain_v03 replace;
     delimiter='09'x;
     getnames=yes;
    run;
    proc print
     data=MEDB5507.backpain_v03;
     var Subject Group Years;
     title "Printout of third import";
    run;

This is the code. Notice how short it is, mostly because you don't have
to tell SAS what the names of the variables are. SAS figures the names
out from the first line of the data file (thanks to the getnames=yes
option). You also don't have to tell SAS which variables are numeric and
which are alphanumeric.

The LOG window, however, looks quite a bit different than the code.
