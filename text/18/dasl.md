The Data and Story Library (DASL) is a collection of small and simple
data sets useful for teaching basic statistical concepts. It was
originally housed at the Carnegie-Mellon website, but (like many classic
websites) it disappeared one day. The nice folks at Data Description,
Inc. (makers of Data Desk software) have revived and updated this
resource.
