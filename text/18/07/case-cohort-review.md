I got a question about how to analyze a case cohort study in Stata. The
person was following the code in a [Stata conference
presentation](https://www.stata.com/meeting/nordic-and-baltic16/slides/norway16_johansson.pdf)
but was unsure about some of the details. Always looking for simple
explanations that I myself don't understand well, I found this nice
article on how these case cohort studies are written up in the
literature. Naturally, it provides a brief explanation of how you
analyze data from a case cohort design along with several helpful
references.
