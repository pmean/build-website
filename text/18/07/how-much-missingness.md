I got a question about how much missing data could you have in a study
and still feel comfortable with your data analysis. It's a question with
no hard and fast answer, but I get the question so often that I have
developed some general guidance.

<!---More--->

Everyone wants a rule on this, and no rule will work. It depends on how
or why the data is missing. Sometimes 5% missing will kill you and
sometimes 90% missing is not a serious issue. Seriously, I have heard
arguments that even 90% missing is not a problem if you make a few
reasonable assumptions about your data and use a rigorous approach to
imputing the missing values. It's easy enough to verify this. Take a
data set with no missing values and remove 90% of the data using a
particular set of assumptions. Then impute using a rigorous approach and
see if the results match those of the original data set.

But here's what I tell people. If less than 10% of your data is missing
and there is nothing too unusual about the data that is missing then
you're probably okay. If more than 30% is missing, there's a good chance
you have problems unless you proceed very carefully.

That's a rule of thumb and I remind people that no one gets thrown in
jail for violating a rule of thumb.

There's also a consideration of the method being used. If you rely on a
simplistic approach, such as complete case analysis or last observation
carried forward, you cannot afford to have more than a small percentage
of missing values. If you use rigorous approaches like multiple
imputation or maximum likelihood approaches to missing data, then you
can tolerate even a very large fraction of missing data. Anyone using
these rigorous approaches, of course, should work closely with a
statistician. Large amounts of missing data is one of the "red flags"
that I look for when deciding how much help a client needs.

Finally, you need to ask yourself why the data is missing, and this
often requires speculation beyond the data set itself. Certain types of
missing value mechanisms, like missing completely at random, are easily
addressed, even if you have a large fraction of missing data. But watch
out for informative missingness or data missing not at random . These
are setting where the fact that a value is missing is directly
associated with the value that you don't know. If you are measuring
something sensitive, and you know that people are more likely to skip
answering if they have this sensitive condition, then even a small
fraction of missing data can cause serious problems.
