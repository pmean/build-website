I have not run too many Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), so I can't
comment too much about this resource, but anytime I see something like
SEM features added to R, I have to rejoice. This page gives a nice
tutorial introduction to lavaan, the R package for SEM, and the material
is pitched at a level easy to follow even for people like me who have a
limited appreciation for SEM terminology.
