If you want to understand big data, you need to understand Hadoop.
Hadoop is the technology underlying many big data efforts. But most of
the descriptions of Hadoop are jargon laden and impenetrable to
newcomers. Well, maybe just impenetrable to this newcomer. But one great
revelation to me was a historical note as to WHY there was a need to
develop Hadoop. It was all those pages that had to be indexed by search
engines at Google and Yahoo. So I went out to try to find more details.
This article, with a ton of references throughout, is an excellent
introduction to the precursors to Hadoop, the development of Hadoop
itself, and the explosion of systems that used Hadoop as their
foundation.
