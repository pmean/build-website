I've done a lot of work with Evidence-Based Health, but one big and
largely unsolved problem is how to get health care professionals to
change their practices once the evidence for these changes becomes
obvious. If no one changes in the face of evidence, then all the effort
to produce and critically appraise the evidence becomes worthless. A new
field, implementation science, has been developed to get at methods to
encourage the adoption of new evidence-based practices. This paper
outlines how implementation science is supposed to work and offers two
real world examples of implementation science studies.
