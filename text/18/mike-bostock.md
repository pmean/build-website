This is an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session with Mike Bostock, a former graphics editor for the New York Times and creator of the d3.js data visualization package. I'll be writing a few things about d3.js once I figure things out. Mike is someone worth watching because he is working on high visibility, high impact stuff.
