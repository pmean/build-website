This is an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session with Mike Bostock, a former
graphics editor for the New York Times and creator of the d3.js data
visualization package. I'll be writing a few things about d3.js once I
figure things out. Mike is someone worth watching, because he is working
on high visibility, high impact stuff.
