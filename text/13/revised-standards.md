This article compares the Bayesian standard of what constitutes
convincing evidence to the frequentist reliance on the p-value to
measure evidence. The author concludes that a much smaller p-value
(0.005 or 0.001) is needed to be consistent with the Bayesian standard.

Excerpt: "Recent advances in Bayesian hypothesis testing have led to the
development of uniformly most powerful Bayesian tests, which represent
an objective, default class of Bayesian hypothesis tests that have the
same rejection regions as classical significance tests. Based on the
correspondence between these two classes of tests, it is possible to
equate the size of classical hypothesis tests with evidence thresholds
in Bayesian tests, and to equate *P* values with Bayes factors. An
examination of these connections suggest that recent concerns over the
lack of reproducibility of scientific studies can be attributed largely
to the conduct of significance tests at unjustifiably high levels of
significance. To correct this problem, evidence thresholds required for
the declaration of a significant finding should be increased to
25--50:1, and to 100--200:1 for the declaration of a highly significant
finding. In terms of classical hypothesis tests, these evidence
standards mandate the conduct of tests at the 0.005 or 0.001 level of
significance." Available at: <http://www.pnas.org/content/110/48/19313>.
