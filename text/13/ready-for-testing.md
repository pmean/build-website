This post is obsolete, but I decided to keep it around for nostalgic reasons.

<!---More--->

I've decided for quite some time that I need to move from a website to a blog.

A blog automates many of the features that I have in my website. In particular, you can use tags to organize pages. Right now I do this manually with my "category" pages, but it is tedious.

I'm going to test the site for a week or so, and then start publicizing it.
