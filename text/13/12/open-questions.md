This is a classic reference that is worth re-posting. No one seems to
know what to do about those pesky open-ended questions you see on a
survey. This article offers practical tips on how to handle this type of
data.

"Any other comments?" Open questions on questionnaires -- a bane or a
bonus to research? O'Cathain A, Thomas KJ. BMC Med Res Methodol 2004:
4(1); 25. Abstract: "Background:<U+00A0> The habitual "any other comments"
general open question at the end of structured questionnaires has the
potential to increase response rates, elaborate responses to closed
questions, and allow respondents to identify new issues not captured in
the closed questions. However, we believe that many researchers have
collected such data and failed to analyse or present it. Discussion:<U+00A0>
General open questions at the end of structured questionnaires can
present a problem because of their uncomfortable status of being
strictly neither qualitative nor quantitative data, the consequent lack
of clarity around how to analyse and report them, and the time and
expertise needed to do so. We suggest that the value of these questions
can be optimised if researchers start with a clear understanding of the
type of data they wish to generate from such a question, and employ an
appropriate strategy when designing the study. The intention can be to
generate depth data or 'stories' from purposively defined groups of
respondents for qualitative analysis, or to produce quantifiable data,
representative of the population sampled, as a 'safety net' to identify
issues which might complement the closed questions. Summary: We
encourage researchers to consider developing a more strategic use of
general open questions at the end of structured questionnaires. This may
optimise the quality of the data and the analysis, reduce dilemmas
regarding whether and how to analyse such data, and result in a more
ethical approach to making best use of the data which respondents kindly
provide." Available at: <http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/4/25>.
