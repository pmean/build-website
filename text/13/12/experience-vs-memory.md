There are a series of experiments that show that your memory of an event
is colored more by the experience at the end of the event. This leads to
some fascinating contradictions between what you should want from a
rational perspective and what you actually want. The speaker is a
Nobel-Prize winning Economist who has developed much of the research in
behavioral economics.

Kahneman D. The riddle of experience vs. memory \| Video on TED.com.
Description: "Using examples from vacations to colonoscopies, Nobel
laureate and founder of behavioral economics Daniel Kahneman reveals how
our "experiencing selves" and our "remembering selves" perceive
happiness differently. This new insight has profound implications for
economics, public policy --- and our own self-awareness." Available at:
