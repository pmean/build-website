I learned R back when the only way to assign a value was with the \<-
operator. For example, if you were computing the hypotenuse of a
triangle, you'd use c \<- sqrt(a\^2+b\^2). But the language now allows
you to use an equals sign instead, which is the choice in many other
programming languages. Should you do this? I say "no" emphatically, but
this website makes an interesting counter-argument.

David Smith, **Use = or \<- for assignment.** Revolutions Blog, December
16, 2008. Excerpt: "A recent thread on the r-help mailing list raises a
common question for beginning R users: should you use = (equals) or \<-
(back arrow) for assignments? In R, both of the following statements
have the effect of assigning the value 3 to the variable x: x = 3 or x
\<- 3. So if they have the same effect, does it matter which you use?"
