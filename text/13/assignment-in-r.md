I learned R back when the only way to assign a value was with the \<-
operator. For example, if you were computing the hypotenuse of a
triangle, you'd use c \<- sqrt(a\^2+b\^2). But the language now allows
you to use an equals sign instead, which is the choice in many other
programming languages. Should you do this? I say "no" emphatically, but
this website makes an interesting counter-argument.
