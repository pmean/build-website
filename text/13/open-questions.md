This is a classic reference that is worth re-posting. No one seems to
know what to do about those pesky open-ended questions you see on a
survey. This article offers practical tips on how to handle this type of
data.

I [summarized this article][sim3] on my website back in 2005.

O'Cathain, A., Thomas, K.J. "Any other comments?" Open questions on questionnaires â€“ a bane or a bonus to research?. BMC Med Res Methodol 4, 25 (2004). DOI: [10.1186/1471-2288-4-25][doi1]
