Mayor S. Row over breast cancer screening shows that scientists bring
some subjectivity into their work. BMJ. 2001;323(7319):956. Excerpt:
"The difficulty of getting scientists to reach a consensus on their
interpretations of trial data was illustrated last week when two
reviewers for the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group published their own
review of mammography screening trials after editors from the group had
disagreed with some of their conclusions." Available at:
