Sutherland WJ, Spiegelhalter D, Burgman M. Policy: Twenty tips for
interpreting scientific claims. Nature. 2013;503(7476):335--337.
doi:10.1038/503335a. Excerpt: "We suggest that the immediate priority is
to improve policy-makers' understanding of the imperfect nature of
science. The essential skills are to be able to intelligently
interrogate experts and advisers, and to understand the quality,
limitations and biases of evidence. We term these interpretive
scientific skills. These skills are more accessible than those required
to understand the fundamental science itself, and can form part of the
broad skill set of most politicians." Available at
