****[StATS]:** Exploring interactions in a linear
regression model (August 1, 2002)**

*Dear Professor Mean, I have a model with two factors. When I ran the
model, it showed a significant interaction between the two factors. What
do I do now? --Troubled Trudy*

Interactions are tricky. It depends a lot on the context of your
problem. If you are looking at an intervention, then an interaction
implies, perhaps, that the effectiveness of the intervention is
different in different subgroups.

Ideally, you should have specified how you would handle the analysis of
a significant interaction in your research protocol, but most people
don't do this ahead of time.

I would look at some graphs first to try to detect the nature of the
interaction. There is a PLOT button on the dialog box of the SPSS
General Linear Model that is probably worth a click. I would also look
at residuals to make sure that the interaction is not caused by a single
outlier that pulls one cell totally out of whack.

SPSS also offers the standard contrasts, though you should read a good
text on ANOVA before applying these mindlessly. Which contrast is best
depends in part on whether your factor represents a nominal, ordinal, or
interval variable.

You also might consider consolidating some of your levels if it makes
sense in the context of your problem, and then see what happens to the
interaction. Or possibly focus on just two levels that are of special
interest to you.
