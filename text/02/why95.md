****[StATS]:** Why 95% confidence limits? (created
2002-05-06)**

*Dear Professor Mean,* *I\'ve been working with small data sets for some
neuroimaging research that have 5 treatment and 5 control participants.
It is not unusual to have such small samples in this kind of work. My
95% confidence interval (CI) included zero; yet, the 85% confidence
interval did not include zero. I know that the 95% CI is the common one,
but I also know that others are used, but I don\'t know when to use
them. Therefore, I\'d like to know why we use 95% confidence limits all
the time. When it is appropriate to use other CIs and the logic behind
making such decisions.*

> If the goal of your research is to end up with a confidence interval

> almost certain to exclude the value of zero.

> In your defense, it sounds like you recognize **the arbitrary nature
> of the 95% confidence level**. The use of 95% confidence limits is
> well recognized in the Statistical community as a historical artifact.
> There are often reasons to increase the confidence level (say to 99%)
> or to decrease the confidence level (say to 90%).
>
> There is a trade-off between the precision of the interval and the
> confidence level. In some contexts, you need to be very confident of
> your findings, and the loss of precision is worth it. In these
> situations, a 99% interval may be more appropriate than a 95%
> interval. In other situations, you prefer to have more precision, and
> you are willing to tolerate being a bit less confident of your
> findings. In these situations, a 90% interval may be more appropriate.
> These discussions closely mirror the tradeoffs between Type I and Type
> II error.
>
> In spite of this, most researchers will react strongly and negatively
> to any change in the confidence level. When you change the confidence
> level, it appears to some that you are **manipulating your data** to
> get a pre-ordained conclusion.
>
> If you want to justify a different confidence level, you need to
> **present that justification in the protocol, before any data is
> collected**.
>
> You should also ask yourself **what precision you would really like to
> have**. A good way to start is to first define a range of clinical
> indifference. In other words, how much of a change is so small that
> the typical researcher would yawn and say \"that\'s not very
> interesting.\"
>
> Finally, saying that sample sizes of 5 are common in your area of work
> places you firmly in the **Lemming school of research design**. Your
> effects have to be two full standard deviations apart in order to
> justify doing the research on only 5 subjects in each group. That\'s a
> Godzilla sized difference\--one that would imply that the best subject
> in one group is still far worse than the worst subject in the other
> group.
>
> Sometimes, a researcher can say with confidence that an \"all or
> nothing\" difference is the only one they are interested in seeing.
> But I suspect that this is not the case with your data. If you saw a
> difference of only one standard deviation, you would probably still
> consider that very interesting. And a sample size that could reliably
> detect such a difference is far larger than 5 per group.
>
> I don\'t mean to be too critical. I don\'t know the full context of
> your research. You really should discuss the implications of your
> research design with a professional statistician before you conduct
> any more research. Not only might you be wasting precious research
> dollars, but there may be serious ethical problems with your research.
