****[StATS]:** So you want to write a questionnaire
(July 12, 2002)**

*Dear Professor Mean, I need to write a questionnaire for a research
study I am conducting. Can you help me write it? -- Cautious Carmen*

Dear Cautious,

If I wrote the questionnaire, it would include a bad joke on every page.

**Short answer**

You need to think about several issues while writing a questionnaire:

-   What is the purpose of your questionnaire?
-   What level of anonymity can you provide?
-   How will you minimize non response?
-   Are you asking the right questions?

Also make sure that you do some pilot testing of your questionnaire.

I'll presume, for the most part, that you are giving a questionnaires
to individual patients, but you can also send them out to groups and
organizations as well.

**What is the purpose of your questionnaire?**

You need to identify the purpose of your survey. Are you trying to
identify

-   attitudes
-   needs
-   behavior
-   demographics

or some combination of the above.

Who are you sampling from and who do you want to generalize these
results to. Will you make any<U+00A0>extrapolations from this survey?

Will you collect the data

-   through a web page
-   through postal mail
-   through FAX
-   through email
-   through the phone
-   through a<U+00A0> face to face interview

Have you considered a focus group as an alternative method for data
collection?

**What level of anonymity can you provide?**

You should provide the greatest degree of anonymity possible and you
should inform your patients what level of anonymity you can provide.

For may questionnaires, you will publish only aggregate results;
individual responses will not be reported. If you have to link the
questionnaire data to a medical record or other source of information,
then you need to inform your patients.

Sometimes you need to track the survey in order to find out who to send
a follow up reminder notice to. This could be done with the use of a
code number on the survey, but if you can, you should assure the patient
that this code will not be used beyond the use of reminder notices.

I am starting to write up a web page about [privacy concerns in
research](privacy.html).

You need to identify any sensitive questions. Some examples include

-   genetic information
-   information about mental illnesses
-   information about sexual attitudes, preferences or practices
-   information on the use or abuse of alcohol and other drugs
-   information on illegal activities

What is sensitive may depend on what group you are asking. Questions
about smoking and alcohol consumption might be more threatening, if your
population is a group of pregnant women.

Ask yourself if the disclosure of this information might embarrass or
harm the respondent. If it can, then you need to take special
precautions.

**How will you minimize non response?**

Some of the people you send your questionnaire to **will not receive**
it. Some of them **will not return** the questionnaire. And those who do
respond, **may not respond to all the questions**. All of this can cause
a serious bias in your data analysis.

Think first about motivation. Why would anyone take the time to fill out
and return your questionnaire? You need to give them some incentive.

-   You might include **something of value with your survey such as cash
    or a gift certificate**. Your budget probably can't afford a large
    incentive, but a large incentive might be considered coercive
    anyway.
-   Sometimes people are motivated by altruism, so you should **explain
    how your questionnaire will help make the world a better place**.
    Make sure that your patients see a link between this questionnaire
    and something that is important to them.
-   Curiosity can also motivate; consider **offering a summary of your
    research findings after the questionnaires have been analyzed**.

Also be sure to avoid common demotivators.

-   Don't give your patients an undue work burden with an **overly long
    and complex questionnaire**.
-   Don't **ask for information that you don't need or which you
    already have**.
-   Don't make your patients **pay for a stamp or a long distance phone
    call**.
-   If you are sending a survey to an organization, don't **send it to
    the wrong department** and certainly don't **send it to a general
    address** with the hope that it will find its way to the right
    person.

If possible, use follow up **reminders by phone, email, or postal mail**
to those who do not respond by the deadline. These reminders can
sometimes raise concerns about anonymity, so be careful about this. Use
coded numbers on the surveys to track who has responded and let them
know that the link between the codes and any personal identifiers will
be destroyed.

The best way to minimize the number of non respondents is to make the
survey clean, simple, and easy to respond to.

-   Most of us have limited attention spans. **Be brief**.
-   Most of us are easily confused and befuddled. **Ask one question at
    a time**. If you are using conjunctions (and/or) in a question, try
    splitting it into two more more simpler questions.
-   Most of us have dreadful memories. **Minimize the amount of
    recollection** that your patients have to do. Don't ask for exact
    numbers when a range will do.
-   Most of us do not handle abstractions well. **Try to ask questions
    about tangible items** and give examples. Avoid questions about
    concepts that are not encountered in daily living.
-   Most of us are impatient. **Ask questions that your patients can
    answer rapidly and without much mental effort**. Avoid questions
    that involve arithmetic computations, such as adding up several
    sources of income. Avoid questions that involve ranking or selecting
    preferences from a long list.

Finally, be sure choose an appropriate language level. For many
questionnaires, you should write at a fifth grade reading level.

In spite of all this some people will not respond. If you can get some
**abbreviated information** from them, such as **demographics or their
reasons for not participating**, that might help. It might determine a
good statistical adjustment for your data. Even if you can't adjust for
it, this information might help you determine the direction and severity
of any bias caused by non response.

**Are you asking the right questions?**

Use standardized questions and scales whenever you can. These standards
were developed and tested over a long period of time, so you know how
they will behave. By using standardized questions, you also make it
easier for anyone who might incorporate your research into a systematic
review or meta-analysis.

A good example of a standardized scale is the Burns Anxiety Inventory.
This is a series of 33 questions about anxious feelings, anxious
thoughts, and physical symptoms. Here are six of the items:

-   Feeling that things around you are strange, unreal or foggy.
-   Apprehension or a sense of impending doom.
-   Racing thoughts or having your mind jump from one thing to the next.
-   Feeling that you're on the verge of losing control.
-   Butterflies or discomfort in the stomach.
-   Tight, tense muscles.

By asking a wide range of questions about anxiety, you are helping to
get an accurate assessment of anxiety, especially for those patients who
might show anxiety in some ways but not in others.

Lack of standards can cause problems. Jadad and Gagliardi (1998)
criticize scales used to rate web sites providing health information.
There were too many of them, most of them did not present any
justification for their

When you are using categories, use the same categories that others use.
Birthweights, for example, as classified as low (LBW) if less than 2500
grams, very low (VLBW) if less than 1500 grams, and extremely low (ELBW)
if less than 1000 grams.<U+00A0>

**Running a pilot study of the questionnaire**

Pilot test your questionnaire.

-   What are you thinking?
-   Remember to read aloud for me.
-   Can you tell me more about that?
-   Could you describe that for me?
-   Remember to tell me what you are doing.

-- Dillman, page 143.

Here are some other issues to examine during a pilot.

-   Were any items skipped frequently?
-   Were any items answered incorrectly or ambiguously?
-   Were any items redundant (no variation, or perfect correlation with
    another item?)
-   Should you add extra categories to certain questions?<U+00A0>

Try to estimate the resources you need to conduct this questionnaire.

**Summary**

[This section is not yet available.]

Thank you for filling out this survey. We don't have enough money to
include a pre-printed envelope. Be sure to use extra postage, since the
survey weighs more than one ounce. We're not sure how we will use this
data and maybe we'll disclose this information to other researchers.
This survey hasn't had any pilot testing, so if we goof up badly, you
might have to fill out a better one later. No one has used the survey
form before, so we're not sure if we'll find out anything interesting.
