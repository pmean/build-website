*Dear Professor Mean, I need to establish validity and reliability of a new measurement. How do I do this?*

<!---more--->

Dear Reader, validity and reliability are two very dangerous words to use, because they mean different things to different people. Here are some issues to consider.

### Face validity

Face validity is the extent to which your measurement appears valid to the general public. Does the measurement make intuitive sense? A closely related concept is content validity, the extent to which your measurement makes intuitive sense to a group of experts in the area.

### Construct validity

Construct validity is establishing that you are measuring what you think you are measuring. You do this in two very different ways. First you establish that your measure correlates well with what it should correlate well with (convergent validity) and is uncorrelated with what it should be uncorrelated with (discriminant validity).

### Criterion validity

Criterion validity is the extent to which your measurement correlates with a gold standard. You can establish this two ways. First, you can see if your measure predicts a future measure that indicates the same thing (predictive validity). Second, you can see if your measure correlates well with other concurrent measures which have been established as gold standards.

### Example

Two large hospitals in the Netherlands studied four risk assessment scales for pressure ulcers (BMJ 2002; 325: 797 (12 October)). Four separate scales were applied to patients without pressure ulcers who were expected to stay at least five days in the hospital. These patients were then followed for up to 12 weeks to see if a pressure ulcer did develop. They showed that all four scales had poor predictive validity--they were unable to make accurate predictions of which patients would develop pressure ulcers. The authors noted that there had been minimal evaluation of these scales beyond expert opinion and literature review.
