*Dear Professor Mean, My colleagues and I argue over the most
appropriate way for displaying tables of percentages. Must the row or
column always add to 100%? Also, in cases where it is difficult to know
which variable is dependent, how does one decide the best way to present
the results? -- Garrulous Gail*

Dear Garrulous,

When you are deciding how to display two by two (or larger) tables,
you have a variety of ways to do this. No way is correct all the time,
and some of choices reflect subjective judgment. But here are some
rules I use.

**1. Never display more than one type of number in a table.**

Statistical software like SPSS can produce counts, row percents,
column percents, cell percents, expected counts, residuals, and/or
cell contribution to chi-squared values. At one time or another you
might want to use each of these statistics, but never all at one time.
Two or more numbers in a table causes confusion and makes your tables
harder to interpret.

Present a single summary statistic in the table if at all possible. If
you need to display two summary statistics (for example, both counts
and row percentages), then place the counts in one table and the row
percentages in a different table. If you have to fit them in the same
table, place the two numbers side by side with the less important
number appearing second and in parentheses For example, 54% (257).

**2. Row percentages are usually best.** 

Row percentages are the
percentages you compute by dividing each count by the row total. Row
percentages place the comparison between two numbers within a single
column, so that one number is directly beneath the number you want to
compare it to. This is usually better than column percents, where the
numbers you want to compare are side by side. If you find that column
percentages make more sense. Consider swapping the rows and columns.

If you find that cell percentages make the most sense, consider
creating composite categories that combine the row and column
categories. Cell percentages are the percentages that you get when you
divide each cell count by the overall total. When cell percents are
interesting, it usually means that you are interested in the four
distinct categories in your two by two table. For example, you are
interested in seeing what fraction of job candidates are white males,
rather than seeing how the probability of being male influences the
probability of being white. For this type of data, treat it as a
single categorical variable with four levels (white males, white
females, black males, black females) rather than two categorical
variables with each having two levels (black/white, male/female).

**3. Place the treatment/exposure variable as rows and outcome
variable as columns.**

This relates to the above item. You usually are
interested in the probability of an outcome like death or disease, and
you are interested in how this probability changes when the treatment
or exposure changes. Arranging the table thusly and using row percents
usually gets you the comparison you are interested in.

**4. If one variable has a lot more levels than the other variable,
place that variable in row.s**

A table that is tall and thin is
usually easier to read than a table that is short and wide. It is
easier to scroll up and down rather than left and right. For a really
large number of levels, you might have to print your table on two or
more pages. Usually it is a lot easier to align these pages if the
table is tall and thin. A short wide table that is split on two or
more pages is often a disaster.

**5. Whenever you report percentages, always round.**

A change on the
order of tenths of a percent are almost never interesting or
important. Displaying that tenth of a percent makes it harder to
manipulate the numbers to see the big picture.

**6. Don't worry about whether your percentages add up to 99% or
101%.**

First of all, it can't happen with a two by two table unless
you round incorrectly. For a larger table, it can happen, but your
audience is sophisticated enough to understand why this is the case.
No one, for example, is going to be upset when 33% plus 33% plus 33%
adds up to less than 100%.

**7. When in doubt, write out your table several different ways.**

Pick out the one that gives the clearest picture of what is really
happening. Don't rely on the first draft of your table, just like you
would never rely on the first draft of your writing.

**Examples**

A simple fictitious example will help illustrate these points.

![](../../../web/images/02/percentage-0201.gif)

We classify people by their income (rich/poor) and also by their
attitude (happy/miserable). There are, for example,   30 rich happy
people in our sample and 70 poor miserable people.

![](../../../web/images/02/percentage-0202.gif)

This figure shows column percentages. We compute this by dividing each
number by the column total.

We see for example that only 25% of all happy people are rich. This is
a conditional probability and is usually written as P[Rich |
Happy]. Read the vertical bar as "given." So this probability is
read as the probability of being rich given that you are happy.

![](../../../web/images/02/percentage-0203.gif)

This figure shows row percentages. We compute this by dividing each
number by the row total.

We see, for example that 75% of rich people are happy. This is a
different conditional probability, P[Happy | Rich]. Read this as
the probability of being happy given that you are rich.

Notice the distinction between the two probabilities. Only a few happy
people are rich, but most rich people are happy.

![](../../../web/images/02/percentage-0204.gif)

This figure shows cell percentages. We compute this by dividing each
number by the grand total. Each percentage represents the probability
of having two conditions. For example, there is a 15% chance of being
rich and happy.

The table above shows a good format for combining two numbers in a
single table.

This is an alternate way of displaying cell percentages.

If we had a six categories for attitude rather than just two, we might
arrange the table differently.

Notice that this table would not require any sideways scrolling.

**Summary**

1.  **Never display more than one type of number in a table.**
2.  **Row percentages are usually best.**
3.  **Place the treatment/exposure variable as rows and outcome variable
    as columns.**
4.  If one variable has a lot more levels than the other variable, place
    that variable in rows.
5.  **Whenever you report percentages, always round.**
6.  **Don't worry about whether your percentages add up to 99% or
    101%.**
7.  **When in doubt, write out your table several different ways.**
