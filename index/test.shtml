<p><b><a href="index.html">P.Mean</a>: Hire me as a consultant</b><strong> (created 2008-07-15)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="news.html">
  <img border="0" src="images/news.png"></a></p>
  <p>Starting on July 15, 2008, I am available for statistical consulting. I 
   have a PhD in Statistics, <a href="resume.html">thirty years of experience</a>, and
   <a href="testimonials.html">many satisfied customers</a>. In the past, I have 
   undertaken independent consulting assignments using my evenings and weekends, 
   but there was not enough time in the week to handle this and keep up with my 
   six year old boy. I am now available full time and can provide you with help 
  on your toughest statistical problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Rates</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It's a bad idea to list rates on a webpage because it will scare people 
   away. I charge  250 U.S. dollars per hour of consulting. Here's what I can do to avoid a 
   bit of the sticker shock.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Offer the <b>first hour for free</b> in any consulting project. I've 
    always done this, and I like this policy as it allows you to explore what 
    services I can provide at no risk. It also helps me to understand the scope 
    of the problem so that I can estimate the total amount of time required.</li>
    <li>Place an <b>upper limit on the hours worked</b> in any consulting 
    project. Once I understand your problem, I will tell you the maximum number 
    of hours that the project will require. If it requires more hours, I will 
    provide those at no cost. If I work less hours than the maximum, you pay 
    less.</li>
    <li>Offer <b>special discounts</b> for specific projects. If you will let me 
    use your data as a teaching example on my website (with appropriate 
    safeguards for anonymity, of course), then I will provide consulting for $75 
    less than my normal hourly rate. If you are a graduate student working on a 
    thesis or dissertation, I will provide consulting for $75 less than my 
    normal consulting rate because I remember what it was like to be a poor 
    struggling graduate student. These discounts can be combined. </li>
    <li>Review the <b>going rates for statistical consultants</b>. A report in 
    the
    <a href="http://www.amstat.org/sections/cnsl/newsletter/pdf_archive/vol23no1.pdf">
    Spring 2006 issue of The Statistical Consultant</a> reports a salary survey 
    for statistical consultants. They noted that &quot;<i>the median hourly rate 
    charged for external clients is $130 with an inter quartile range of $89 - 
    $189</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>Ph.D.'s charge on average $44 more per hour than those 
    with a Master's degree across all types of tasks.</i>&quot; Prices, undoubtedly, 
    have gone up since 2006.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p><b>What can I help with?</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Statistical consulting usually covers four stages of research, the initial 
   planning stage, the data collection stage, the data analysis stage, and the 
   reporting stage. I also have expertise in Evidence Based Health Care and in 
   research ethics. Here's a list (though not an exhaustive list) of the ways I 
   can help.</p>
  <p><b>Initial planning</b>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>defining an appropriate research hypothesis,</li>
    <li>developing a plan for early stopping of a trial,</li>
    <li>selecting an appropriate sample size,</li>
    <li>submitting a protocol for ethical review,</li>
    <li>preparing randomization tables,</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Data collection</b>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>selecting an appropriate system for data entry,</li>
    <li>monitoring accrual rates to keep project on time,</li>
    <li>evaluating conditions that might call for early termination.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Data analysis</b>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>choosing software appropriate for your analysis needs,</li>
    <li>screening data for obvious errors,</li>
    <li>producing simple descriptive statistics,</li>
    <li>assessing reliability and validity,</li>
    <li>fitting a linear, logistic, or Poisson regression model,</li>
    <li>analyzing time-to-event data (survival curves).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Reporting.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>documenting the statistical methods used in the data analysis,</li>
    <li>producing graphs and tables that are easily comprehended,</li>
    <li>preparing bibliographic entries relevant to the statistical analysis.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Evidence Based Health Care</b>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>preparing a critical review of a research article.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Research ethics</b>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>outlining the limitations on the use of randomization, blinding, and 
    placebos.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Are you interested in a short course or seminar?</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have developed a whole series of classes about data analysis, research 
design, evidence-based medicine, and research ethics that I can
<a href="08/TeachingClasses.html">teach for a small fee</a>. I am also hoping to 
develop some web seminars on these topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Interested?</b></p>
