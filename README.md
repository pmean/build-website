# blogdown-backup

I am using the R package, blogdown, to consolidate
and update my website. I do this with two separate
directories, blogdown and blogdown-backup. It seems
strange, but I cannot seem to create my website and
backup all the files onto github without using two
directories. It is probably just my lack of
understanding. So here is how everything works.

I create text files in Markdown (md) or R Markdown
(Rmd) files in the backup folder and transfer them 
to the blogdown folder for processing.
